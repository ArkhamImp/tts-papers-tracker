- **Abstract**: Despite rapid progress in text-to-speech (TTS), open-source systems still lack truly instruction-following, fine-grained control over core speech attributes (e.g., pitch, speaking rate, age, emotion, and style). We present VoiceSculptor, an open-source unified system that bridges this gap by integrating instruction-based voice design and high-fidelity voice cloning in a single framework. It generates controllable speaker timbre directly from natural-language descriptions, supports iterative refinement via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and provides attribute-level edits across multiple dimensions. The designed voice is then rendered into a prompt waveform and fed into a cloning model to enable high-fidelity timbre transfer for downstream speech synthesis. VoiceSculptor achieves open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) on InstructTTSEval-Zh, and is fully open-sourced, including code and pretrained models, to advance reproducible instruction-controlled TTS research.

## DSA-Tokenizer: Disentangled Semantic-Acoustic Tokenization via Flow Matching-based Hierarchical Fusion
- **Authors**: Hanlin Zhang et.al.

- **Tags**: codec
- **Abstract**: Speech tokenizers serve as the cornerstone of discrete Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). Existing tokenizers either prioritize semantic encoding, fuse semantic content with acoustic style inseparably, or achieve incomplete semantic-acoustic disentanglement. To achieve better disentanglement, we propose DSA-Tokenizer, which explicitly disentangles speech into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens via distinct optimization constraints. Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality. Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling. Audio samples are avaialble at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DSA_Tokenizer_demo/. The code and model will be made publicly available after the paper has been accepted.

## ESDD2: Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan
- **Authors**: Xueping Zhang et.al.

- **Abstract**: Audio recorded in real-world environments often contains a mixture of foreground speech and background environmental sounds. With rapid advances in text-to-speech, voice conversion, and other generation models, either component can now be modified independently. Such component-level manipulations are harder to detect, as the remaining unaltered component can mislead the systems designed for whole deepfake audio, and they often sound more natural to human listeners. To address this gap, we have proposed CompSpoofV2 dataset and a separation-enhanced joint learning framework. CompSpoofV2 is a large-scale curated dataset designed for component-level audio anti-spoofing, which contains over 250k audio samples, with a total duration of approximately 283 hours. Based on the CompSpoofV2 and the separation-enhanced joint learning framework, we launch the Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge (ESDD2), focusing on component-level spoofing, where both speech and environmental sounds may be manipulated or synthesized, creating a more challenging and realistic detection scenario. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2026 (ICME 2026).
