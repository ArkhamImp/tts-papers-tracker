## EmoAra: Emotion-Preserving English Speech Transcription and Cross-Lingual Translation with Arabic Text-to-Speech
- **Authors**: Besher Hassan et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2602.01170](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01170)
- **Tags**: expressive, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This work presents EmoAra, an end-to-end emotion-preserving pipeline for cross-lingual spoken communication, motivated by banking customer service where emotional context affects service quality. EmoAra integrates Speech Emotion Recognition, Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, and Text-to-Speech to process English speech and deliver an Arabic spoken output while retaining emotional nuance. The system uses a CNN-based emotion classifier, Whisper for English transcription, a fine-tuned MarianMT model for English-to-Arabic translation, and MMS-TTS-Ara for Arabic speech synthesis. Experiments report an F1-score of 94% for emotion classification, translation performance of BLEU 56 and BERTScore F1 88.7%, and an average human evaluation score of 81% on banking-domain translations. The implementation and resources are available at the accompanying GitHub repository.

## Bias in the Ear of the Listener: Assessing Sensitivity in Audio Language Models Across Linguistic, Demographic, and Positional Variations
- **Authors**: Sheng-Lun Wei et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2602.01030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01030)
- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: This work presents the first systematic investigation of speech bias in multilingual MLLMs. We construct and release the BiasInEar dataset, a speech-augmented benchmark based on Global MMLU Lite, spanning English, Chinese, and Korean, balanced by gender and accent, and totaling 70.8 hours ($\approx$4,249 minutes) of speech with 11,200 questions. Using four complementary metrics (accuracy, entropy, APES, and Fleiss' $κ$), we evaluate nine representative models under linguistic (language and accent), demographic (gender), and structural (option order) perturbations. Our findings reveal that MLLMs are relatively robust to demographic factors but highly sensitive to language and option order, suggesting that speech can amplify existing structural biases. Moreover, architectural design and reasoning strategy substantially affect robustness across languages. Overall, this study establishes a unified framework for assessing fairness and robustness in speech-integrated LLMs, bridging the gap between text- and speech-based evaluation.
