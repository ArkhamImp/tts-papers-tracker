- **Abstract**: Neural codec language models achieve impressive zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) by fully imitating the acoustic characteristics of a short speech prompt, including timbre, prosody, and paralinguistic information. However, such holistic imitation limits their ability to isolate and control individual attributes. In this paper, we present a unified codec language model SpeechEdit that extends zero-shot TTS with a selective control mechanism. By default, SpeechEdit reproduces the complete acoustic profile inferred from the speech prompt, but it selectively overrides only the attributes specified by explicit control instructions. To enable controllable modeling, SpeechEdit is trained on our newly constructed LibriEdit dataset, which provides delta (difference-aware) training pairs derived from LibriHeavy. Experimental results show that our approach maintains naturalness and robustness while offering flexible and localized control over desired attributes.

## ParaMETA: Towards Learning Disentangled Paralinguistic Speaking Styles Representations from Speech
- **Authors**: Haowei Lou et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.12289](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12289)
- **Tags**: expressive
- **Abstract**: Learning representative embeddings for different types of speaking styles, such as emotion, age, and gender, is critical for both recognition tasks (e.g., cognitive computing and human-computer interaction) and generative tasks (e.g., style-controllable speech generation). In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ParaMETA outperforms strong baselines in classification accuracy and generates more natural and expressive speech, while maintaining a lightweight and efficient model suitable for real-world applications.

## Confidence-based Filtering for Speech Dataset Curation with Generative Speech Enhancement Using Discrete Tokens
- **Authors**: Kazuki Yamauchi et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.12254](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12254)
- **Tags**: codec
- **Abstract**: Generative speech enhancement (GSE) models show great promise in producing high-quality clean speech from noisy inputs, enabling applications such as curating noisy text-to-speech (TTS) datasets into high-quality ones. However, GSE models are prone to hallucination errors, such as phoneme omissions and speaker inconsistency, which conventional error filtering based on non-intrusive speech quality metrics often fails to detect. To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models.
