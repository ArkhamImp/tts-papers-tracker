- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied. Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats.

## Towards Prosodically Informed Mizo TTS without Explicit Tone Markings

- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper reports on the development of a text-to-speech (TTS) system for Mizo, a low-resource, tonal, and Tibeto-Burman language spoken primarily in the Indian state of Mizoram. The TTS was built with only 5.18 hours of data; however, in terms of subjective and objective evaluations, the outputs were considered perceptually acceptable and intelligible. A baseline model using Tacotron2 was built, and then, with the same data, another TTS model was built with VITS. In both subjective and objective evaluations, the VITS model outperformed the Tacotron2 model. In terms of tone synthesis, the VITS model showed significantly lower tone errors than the Tacotron2 model. The paper demonstrates that a non-autoregressive, end-to-end framework can achieve synthesis of acceptable perceptual quality and intelligibility.
