## Now You Hear Me: Audio Narrative Attacks Against Large Audio-Language Models
- **Authors**: Ye Yu et.al.

- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: Large audio-language models increasingly operate on raw speech inputs, enabling more seamless integration across domains such as voice assistants, education, and clinical triage. This transition, however, introduces a distinct class of vulnerabilities that remain largely uncharacterized. We examine the security implications of this modality shift by designing a text-to-audio jailbreak that embeds disallowed directives within a narrative-style audio stream. The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text. When delivered through synthetic speech, the narrative format elicits restricted outputs from state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, achieving a 98.26% success rate that substantially exceeds text-only baselines. These results highlight the need for safety frameworks that jointly reason over linguistic and paralinguistic representations, particularly as speech-based interfaces become more prevalent.

## EmoShift: Lightweight Activation Steering for Enhanced Emotion-Aware Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Li Zhou et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.22873](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22873)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Achieving precise and controllable emotional expression is crucial for producing natural and context-appropriate speech in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.

## Evaluating and Rewarding LALMs for Expressive Role-Play TTS via Mean Continuation Log-Probability
- **Authors**: Yong Ren et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.22661](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22661)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended Text-to-Speech (TTS) to interactive role-play scenarios, which demand high expressiveness and strict adherence to role-play instructions. However, existing models struggle to maintain stylistic consistency with character profiles and scene descriptions across multi-turn dialogues. A critical bottleneck is the lack of objective metrics for quantifying speaking style. To bridge this gap, we propose Mean Continuation Log-Probability (MCLP) as both an evaluation metric and a reward signal, validated on LALM-based Role-Play TTS (RP-TTS) tasks. Critically, we leverage the In-Context Learning capability of pre-trained LALMs to formulate MCLP via a continuation log-probability prediction. This metric quantifies stylistic consistency by measuring the likelihood of the ground-truth speech conditioned on the generated speech. Furthermore, we employ MCLP as a reinforcement learning reward to enhance the style alignment between generated speech and Role-Play instructions. To facilitate evaluation, we construct an RP-TTS dataset with rich scene and character annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LALM baselines on both objective and subjective metrics.
