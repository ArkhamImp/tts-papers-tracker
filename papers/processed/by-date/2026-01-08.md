## CosyEdit: Unlocking End-to-End Speech Editing Capability from Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Models

- **Tags**: zero-shot, editing, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Automatic speech editing aims to modify spoken content based on textual instructions, yet traditional cascade systems suffer from complex preprocessing pipelines and a reliance on explicit external temporal alignment. Addressing these limitations, we propose CosyEdit, an end-to-end speech editing model adapted from CosyVoice through task-specific fine-tuning and an optimized inference procedure, which internalizes speech-text alignment while ensuring high consistency between the speech before and after editing. By fine-tuning on only 250 hours of supervised data from our curated GigaEdit dataset, our 400M-parameter model achieves reliable speech editing performance. Experiments on the RealEdit benchmark indicate that CosyEdit not only outperforms several billion-parameter language model baselines but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art cascade approaches. These results demonstrate that, with task-specific fine-tuning and inference optimization, robust and efficient speech editing capabilities can be unlocked from a zero-shot TTS model, yielding a novel and cost-effective end-to-end solution for high-quality speech editing.

## FlexiVoice: Enabling Flexible Style Control in Zero-Shot TTS with Natural Language Instructions
- **Authors**: Dekun Chen et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.04656](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04656)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, expressive, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This study proposes FlexiVoice, a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system capable of flexible style control with zero-shot voice cloning. The speaking style is controlled by a natural-language instruction and the voice timbre is provided by a speech reference in zero-shot manner. FlexiVoice is built with an LLM core, which takes text as input, and also takes an optional natural language instruction and an optional speech reference to control style and timbre, respectively. FlexiVoice is equipped with a novel Progressive Post-Training (PPT) scheme that progressively unlocks accurate and flexible controllability. In particular, it first employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enable FlexiVoice to accurately follow both natural language instruction and speech reference simultaneously. It then uses a multi-objective Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to disentangle style instruction, reference timbre, and textual content. Finally, it adapts instruction GRPO for more advanced instruction following. Experimental results show that FlexiVoice surpasses competing baselines and demonstrates strong capability in decoupling control factors. Human evaluations further confirm its naturalness, controllability, and robustness. Audio samples are available at https://flexi-voice.github.io.
