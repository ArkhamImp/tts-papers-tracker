- **Abstract**: With the recent advancements in reasoning capabilities, tool calling using MCP servers and Audio Language Models (ALMs), development and integration of multi-modal agents (with voice and text support) has come to the industry forefront. Cascading pipelines for voice agents still play a central role in the industry owing to their superior reasoning capabilities facilitated by LLMs. Although, cascading pipelines often present error propagation through the pipeline. We propose a framework, FOCAL to benchmark end-to-end reasoning, component-wise error propagation and error analysis for automated as well as human-assisted testing of multi-modal agents (voice to voice + text input). We also share two novel metrics viz. Reasoning and Semantic scores to evaluate efficacy of the agent in having meaningful conversations in voice mode.
