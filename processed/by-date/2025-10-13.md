## BridgeCode: A Dual Speech Representation Paradigm for Autoregressive Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis

- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: While mel-spectrograms have been widely utilized as intermediate representations in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), their inherent redundancy leads to inefficiency in learning text-speech alignment. Compact VAE-based latent representations have recently emerged as a stronger alternative, but they also face a fundamental optimization dilemma: higher-dimensional latent spaces improve reconstruction quality and speaker similarity, but degrade intelligibility, while lower-dimensional spaces improve intelligibility at the expense of reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we propose Semantic-VAE, a novel VAE framework that utilizes semantic alignment regularization in the latent space. This design alleviates the reconstruction-generation trade-off by capturing semantic structure in high-dimensional latent representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-VAE significantly improves synthesis quality and training efficiency. When integrated into F5-TTS, our method achieves 2.10% WER and 0.64 speaker similarity on LibriSpeech-PC, outperforming mel-based systems (2.23%, 0.60) and vanilla acoustic VAE baselines (2.65%, 0.59). We also release the code and models to facilitate further research.

## Perturbation Self-Supervised Representations for Cross-Lingual Emotion TTS: Stage-Wise Modeling of Emotion and Speaker
- **Authors**: Cheng Gong et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2510.11124](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11124)
- **Tags**: expressive, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: The increasing realism of synthetic speech generated by advanced text-to-speech (TTS) models, coupled with post-processing and laundering techniques, presents a significant challenge for audio forensic detection. In this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation) Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection models across progressively harder scenarios: raw synthetic speech, processed audio (e.g., compression, resampling), and laundered audio intended to evade forensic analysis. The SAFE challenge consisted of a total of 90 hours of audio and 21,000 audio samples split across 21 different real sources and 17 different TTS models and 3 tasks. We present the challenge, evaluation design and tasks, dataset details, and initial insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches, offering a foundation for advancing synthetic audio detection research.
