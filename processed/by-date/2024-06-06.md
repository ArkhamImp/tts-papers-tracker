## Small-E: Small Language Model with Linear Attention for Efficient Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: In this paper, we propose MakeSinger, a semi-supervised training method for singing voice synthesis (SVS) via classifier-free diffusion guidance. The challenge in SVS lies in the costly process of gathering aligned sets of text, pitch, and audio data. MakeSinger enables the training of the diffusion-based SVS model from any speech and singing voice data regardless of its labeling, thereby enhancing the quality of generated voices with large amount of unlabeled data. At inference, our novel dual guiding mechanism gives text and pitch guidance on the reverse diffusion step by estimating the score of masked input. Experimental results show that the model trained in a semi-supervised manner outperforms other baselines trained only on the labeled data in terms of pronunciation, pitch accuracy and overall quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adding Text-to-Speech (TTS) data in training, the model can synthesize the singing voices of TTS speakers even without their singing voices.

- **Abstract**: In recent years, text-to-speech (TTS) technology has witnessed impressive advancements, particularly with large-scale training datasets, showcasing human-level speech quality and impressive zero-shot capabilities on unseen speakers. However, despite human subjective evaluations, such as the mean opinion score (MOS), remaining the gold standard for assessing the quality of synthetic speech, even state-of-the-art TTS approaches have kept human feedback isolated from training that resulted in mismatched training objectives and evaluation metrics. In this work, we investigate a novel topic of integrating subjective human evaluation into the TTS training loop. Inspired by the recent success of reinforcement learning from human feedback, we propose a comprehensive sampling-annotating-learning framework tailored to TTS optimization, namely uncertainty-aware optimization (UNO). Specifically, UNO eliminates the need for a reward model or preference data by directly maximizing the utility of speech generations while considering the uncertainty that lies in the inherent variability in subjective human speech perception and evaluations. Experimental results of both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that UNO considerably improves the zero-shot performance of TTS models in terms of MOS, word error rate, and speaker similarity. Additionally, we present a remarkable ability of UNO that it can adapt to the desired speaking style in emotional TTS seamlessly and flexibly.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation in Prompt-based Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Context-Aware Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining

- **Tags**: multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: There is a rising interest and trend in research towards directly translating speech from one language to another, known as end-to-end speech-to-speech translation. However, most end-to-end models struggle to outperform cascade models, i.e., a pipeline framework by concatenating speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech models. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexities involved in direct translation tasks and the scarcity of data. In this study, we introduce a novel model framework TransVIP that leverages diverse datasets in a cascade fashion yet facilitates end-to-end inference through joint probability. Furthermore, we propose two separated encoders to preserve the speaker's voice characteristics and isochrony from the source speech during the translation process, making it highly suitable for scenarios such as video dubbing. Our experiments on the French-English language pair demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation model.

## Improving Audio Codec-based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Multi-Modal Context and Large Language Model
- **Authors**: Jinlong Xue et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2406.03706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03706)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, multilingual, llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper proposes an audio-conditioned phonemic and prosodic annotation model for building text-to-speech (TTS) datasets from unlabeled speech samples. For creating a TTS dataset that consists of label-speech paired data, the proposed annotation model leverages an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels from unlabeled speech samples. By fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained ASR model, we can construct the annotation model using a limited amount of label-speech paired data within an existing TTS dataset. To alleviate the shortage of label-speech paired data for training the annotation model, we generate pseudo label-speech paired data using text-only corpora and an auxiliary TTS model. This TTS model is also trained with the existing TTS dataset. Experimental results show that the TTS model trained with the dataset created by the proposed annotation method can synthesize speech as naturally as the one trained with a fully-labeled dataset.

## Parallel Synthesis for Autoregressive Speech Generation

- **Abstract**: In neural text-to-speech (TTS), two-stage system or a cascade of separately learned models have shown synthesis quality close to human speech. For example, FastSpeech2 transforms an input text to a mel-spectrogram and then HiFi-GAN generates a raw waveform from a mel-spectogram where they are called an acoustic feature generator and a neural vocoder respectively. However, their training pipeline is somewhat cumbersome in that it requires a fine-tuning and an accurate speech-text alignment for optimal performance. In this work, we present end-to-end text-to-speech (E2E-TTS) model which has a simplified training pipeline and outperforms a cascade of separately learned models. Specifically, our proposed model is jointly trained FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN with an alignment module. Since there is no acoustic feature mismatch between training and inference, it does not requires fine-tuning. Furthermore, we remove dependency on an external speech-text alignment tool by adopting an alignment learning objective in our joint training framework. Experiments on LJSpeech corpus shows that the proposed model outperforms publicly available, state-of-the-art implementations of ESPNet2-TTS on subjective evaluation (MOS) and some objective evaluations.
