- **Abstract**: We introduce SupertonicTTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for efficient and streamlined speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS delivers performance comparable to contemporary zero-shot TTS models with only 44M parameters, while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational cost.

## Your voice is your voice: Supporting Self-expression through Speech Generation and LLMs in Augmented and Alternative Communication

- **Abstract**: Vision-guided speech generation aims to produce authentic speech from facial appearance or lip motions without relying on auditory signals, offering significant potential for applications such as dubbing in filmmaking and assisting individuals with aphonia. Despite recent progress, existing methods struggle to achieve unified cross-modal alignment across semantics, timbre, and emotional prosody from visual cues, prompting us to propose Consistent Video-to-Speech (CV2S) as an extended task to enhance cross-modal consistency. To tackle emerging challenges, we introduce ImaginTalk, a novel cross-modal diffusion framework that generates faithful speech using only visual input, operating within a discrete space. Specifically, we propose a discrete lip aligner that predicts discrete speech tokens from lip videos to capture semantic information, while an error detector identifies misaligned tokens, which are subsequently refined through masked language modeling with BERT. To further enhance the expressiveness of the generated speech, we develop a style diffusion transformer equipped with a face-style adapter that adaptively customizes identity and prosody dynamics across both the channel and temporal dimensions while ensuring synchronization with lip-aware semantic features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImaginTalk can generate high-fidelity speech with more accurate semantic details and greater expressiveness in timbre and emotion compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Demos are shown at our project page: https://imagintalk.github.io.

## From Faces to Voices: Learning Hierarchical Representations for High-quality Video-to-Speech

- **Abstract**: We introduce AV-Flow, an audio-visual generative model that animates photo-realistic 4D talking avatars given only text input. In contrast to prior work that assumes an existing speech signal, we synthesize speech and vision jointly. We demonstrate human-like speech synthesis, synchronized lip motion, lively facial expressions and head pose; all generated from just text characters. The core premise of our approach lies in the architecture of our two parallel diffusion transformers. Intermediate highway connections ensure communication between the audio and visual modalities, and thus, synchronized speech intonation and facial dynamics (e.g., eyebrow motion). Our model is trained with flow matching, leading to expressive results and fast inference. In case of dyadic conversations, AV-Flow produces an always-on avatar, that actively listens and reacts to the audio-visual input of a user. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms prior work, synthesizing natural-looking 4D talking avatars. Project page: https://aggelinacha.github.io/AV-Flow/
