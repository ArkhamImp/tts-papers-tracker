- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, particularly in voice cloning, have intensified the demand for adaptable and efficient deepfake detection methods. As TTS systems continue to evolve, detection models must be able to efficiently adapt to previously unseen generation models with minimal data. This paper introduces ADD-GP, a few-shot adaptive framework based on a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier for Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD). We show how the combination of a powerful deep embedding model with the Gaussian processes flexibility can achieve strong performance and adaptability. Additionally, we show this approach can also be used for personalized detection, with greater robustness to new TTS models and one-shot adaptability. To support our evaluation, a benchmark dataset is constructed for this task using new state-of-the-art voice cloning models.

- **Abstract**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation $\href{https://github.com/boson-ai/EmergentTTS-Eval-public}{code}$ and the $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/bosonai/EmergentTTS-Eval}{dataset}$.

## Universal Preference-Score-based Pairwise Speech Quality Assessment

- **Abstract**: The integration of generative artificial intelligence into educational applications has enhanced personalized and interactive learning experiences, and it shows strong potential to promote young learners language acquisition. However, it is still challenging to ensure consistent and robust performance across different languages and cultural contexts, and kids-friendly design requires simplified instructions, engaging interactions, and age-appropriate scaffolding to maintain motivation and optimize learning outcomes. In this work, we introduce SingaKids, a dialogic tutor designed to facilitate language learning through picture description tasks. Our system integrates dense image captioning, multilingual dialogic interaction, speech understanding, and engaging speech generation to create an immersive learning environment in four languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. We further improve the system through multilingual pre-training, task-specific tuning, and scaffolding optimization. Empirical studies with elementary school students demonstrate that SingaKids provides effective dialogic teaching, benefiting learners at different performance levels.

## Speech-to-Speech Translation Pipelines for Conversations in Low-Resource Languages

- **Abstract**: This paper introduces PhoAudiobook, a newly curated dataset comprising 941 hours of high-quality audio for Vietnamese text-to-speech. Using PhoAudiobook, we conduct experiments on three leading zero-shot TTS models: VALL-E, VoiceCraft, and XTTS-V2. Our findings demonstrate that PhoAudiobook consistently enhances model performance across various metrics. Moreover, VALL-E and VoiceCraft exhibit superior performance in synthesizing short sentences, highlighting their robustness in handling diverse linguistic contexts. We publicly release PhoAudiobook to facilitate further research and development in Vietnamese text-to-speech.

## Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech for Vietnamese
- **Authors**: Thi Vu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2506.01322](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01322)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS).

- **Abstract**: The popularity of automatic speech-to-speech translation for human conversations is growing, but the quality varies significantly depending on the language pair. In a context of community interpreting for low-resource languages, namely Turkish and Pashto to/from French, we collected fine-tuning and testing data, and compared systems using several automatic metrics (BLEU, COMET, and BLASER) and human assessments. The pipelines included automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis, with local models and cloud-based commercial ones. Some components have been fine-tuned on our data. We evaluated over 60 pipelines and determined the best one for each direction. We also found that the ranks of components are generally independent of the rest of the pipeline.

- **Abstract**: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a multi-stream text-to-speech system. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the trained model outperforms Japanese baseline models in both naturalness and meaningfulness.

## Zero-Shot Streaming Text to Speech Synthesis with Transducer and Auto-Regressive Modeling
- **Authors**: Haiyang Sun et.al.

- **Tags**: zero-shot, streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Deepfake generation methods are evolving fast, making fake media harder to detect and raising serious societal concerns. Most deepfake detection and dataset creation research focuses on monolingual content, often overlooking the challenges of multilingual and code-switched speech, where multiple languages are mixed within the same discourse. Code-switching, especially between Arabic and English, is common in the Arab world and is widely used in digital communication. This linguistic mixing poses extra challenges for deepfake detection, as it can confuse models trained mostly on monolingual data. To address this, we introduce \textbf{ArEnAV}, the first large-scale Arabic-English audio-visual deepfake dataset featuring intra-utterance code-switching, dialectal variation, and monolingual Arabic content. It \textbf{contains 387k videos and over 765 hours of real and fake videos}. Our dataset is generated using a novel pipeline integrating four Text-To-Speech and two lip-sync models, enabling comprehensive analysis of multilingual multimodal deepfake detection. We benchmark our dataset against existing monolingual and multilingual datasets, state-of-the-art deepfake detection models, and a human evaluation, highlighting its potential to advance deepfake research.
