- **Abstract**: Several recent studies have tested the use of transformer language model representations to infer prosodic features for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). While these studies have explored prosody in general, in this work, we look specifically at the prediction of contrastive focus on personal pronouns. This is a particularly challenging task as it often requires semantic, discursive and/or pragmatic knowledge to predict correctly. We collect a corpus of utterances containing contrastive focus and we evaluate the accuracy of a BERT model, finetuned to predict quantized acoustic prominence features, on these samples. We also investigate how past utterances can provide relevant information for this prediction. Furthermore, we evaluate the controllability of pronoun prominence in a TTS model conditioned on acoustic prominence features.
