- **Abstract**: Previous works in zero-shot text-to-speech (ZS-TTS) have attempted to enhance its systems by enlarging the training data through crowd-sourcing or augmenting existing speech data. However, the use of low-quality data has led to a decline in the overall system performance. To avoid such degradation, instead of directly augmenting the input data, we propose a latent filling (LF) method that adopts simple but effective latent space data augmentation in the speaker embedding space of the ZS-TTS system. By incorporating a consistency loss, LF can be seamlessly integrated into existing ZS-TTS systems without the need for additional training stages. Experimental results show that LF significantly improves speaker similarity while preserving speech quality.
