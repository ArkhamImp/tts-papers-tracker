- **Abstract**: TTS (Text-to-Speech) document reader from Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, and OpenAI have been serviced worldwide. They provide relatively good TTS results for general plain text, but sometimes skip contents or provide unsatisfactory results for mathematical expressions. This is because most modern academic papers are written in LaTeX, and when LaTeX formulas are compiled, they are rendered as distinctive text forms within the document. However, traditional TTS document readers output only the text as it is recognized, without considering the mathematical meaning of the formulas. To address this issue, we propose MathReader, which effectively integrates OCR, a fine-tuned T5 model, and TTS. MathReader demonstrated a lower Word Error Rate (WER) than existing TTS document readers, such as Microsoft Edge and Adobe Acrobat, when processing documents containing mathematical formulas. MathReader reduced the WER from 0.510 to 0.281 compared to Microsoft Edge, and from 0.617 to 0.281 compared to Adobe Acrobat. This will significantly contribute to alleviating the inconvenience faced by users who want to listen to documents, especially those who are visually impaired. The code is available at https://github.com/hyeonsieun/MathReader.

## IndexTTS: An Industrial-Level Controllable and Efficient Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech System
- **Authors**: Wei Deng et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2502.05512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05512)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: The imitation of voice, targeted on specific speech attributes such as timbre and speaking style, is crucial in speech generation. However, existing methods rely heavily on annotated data, and struggle with effectively disentangling timbre and style, leading to challenges in achieving controllable generation, especially in zero-shot scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Vevo, a versatile zero-shot voice imitation framework with controllable timbre and style. Vevo operates in two core stages: (1) Content-Style Modeling: Given either text or speech's content tokens as input, we utilize an autoregressive transformer to generate the content-style tokens, which is prompted by a style reference; (2) Acoustic Modeling: Given the content-style tokens as input, we employ a flow-matching transformer to produce acoustic representations, which is prompted by a timbre reference. To obtain the content and content-style tokens of speech, we design a fully self-supervised approach that progressively decouples the timbre, style, and linguistic content of speech. Specifically, we adopt VQ-VAE as the tokenizer for the continuous hidden features of HuBERT. We treat the vocabulary size of the VQ-VAE codebook as the information bottleneck, and adjust it carefully to obtain the disentangled speech representations. Solely self-supervised trained on 60K hours of audiobook speech data, without any fine-tuning on style-specific corpora, Vevo matches or surpasses existing methods in accent and emotion conversion tasks. Additionally, Vevo's effectiveness in zero-shot voice conversion and text-to-speech tasks further demonstrates its strong generalization and versatility.
