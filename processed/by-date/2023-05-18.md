- **Abstract**: Reference-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models can generate multiple, prosodically-different renditions of the same target text. Such models jointly learn a latent acoustic space during training, which can be sampled from during inference. Controlling these models during inference typically requires finding an appropriate reference utterance, which is non-trivial. Large generative language models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance in various language-related tasks. Given only a natural language query text (the prompt), such models can be used to solve specific, context-dependent tasks. Recent work in TTS has attempted similar prompt-based control of novel speaking style generation. Those methods do not require a reference utterance and can, under ideal conditions, be controlled with only a prompt. But existing methods typically require a prompt-labelled speech corpus for jointly training a prompt-conditioned encoder. In contrast, we instead employ an LLM to directly suggest prosodic modifications for a controllable TTS model, using contextual information provided in the prompt. The prompt can be designed for a multitude of tasks. Here, we give two demonstrations: control of speaking style; prosody appropriate for a given dialogue context. The proposed method is rated most appropriate in 50% of cases vs. 31% for a baseline model.

## FastFit: Towards Real-Time Iterative Neural Vocoder by Replacing U-Net Encoder With Multiple STFTs

- **Abstract**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have shown promising performance for speech synthesis. However, a large number of iterative steps are required to achieve high sample quality, which restricts the inference speed. Maintaining sample quality while increasing sampling speed has become a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a "Co"nsistency "Mo"del-based "Speech" synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a single diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The consistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a well-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior performances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by generating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves an inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based speech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective evaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the proposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling based CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable audio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines.

## CLAPSpeech: Learning Prosody from Text Context with Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training
- **Authors**: Zhenhui Ye et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2305.10763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10763)
- **Tags**: expressive, multilingual
- **Abstract**: In recent years, the field of image generation has been revolutionized by the application of autoregressive transformers and DDPMs. These approaches model the process of image generation as a step-wise probabilistic processes and leverage large amounts of compute and data to learn the image distribution. This methodology of improving performance need not be confined to images. This paper describes a way to apply advances in the image generative domain to speech synthesis. The result is TorToise -- an expressive, multi-voice text-to-speech system. All model code and trained weights have been open-sourced at https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts.
