## Audio-conditioned phonemic and prosodic annotation for building text-to-speech models from unlabeled speech data

- **Abstract**: We introduce LibriTTS-P, a new corpus based on LibriTTS-R that includes utterance-level descriptions (i.e., prompts) of speaking style and speaker-level prompts of speaker characteristics. We employ a hybrid approach to construct prompt annotations: (1) manual annotations that capture human perceptions of speaker characteristics and (2) synthetic annotations on speaking style. Compared to existing English prompt datasets, our corpus provides more diverse prompt annotations for all speakers of LibriTTS-R. Experimental results for prompt-based controllable TTS demonstrate that the TTS model trained with LibriTTS-P achieves higher naturalness than the model using the conventional dataset. Furthermore, the results for style captioning tasks show that the model utilizing LibriTTS-P generates 2.5 times more accurate words than the model using a conventional dataset. Our corpus, LibriTTS-P, is available at https://github.com/line/LibriTTS-P.

- **Abstract**: With current state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, it is not possible to transcribe overlapping speech audio streams separately. Consequently, when these ASR systems are used as part of a social robot like Pepper for interaction with a human, it is common practice to close the robot's microphone while it is talking itself. This prevents the human users to interrupt the robot, which limits speech-based human-robot interaction. To enable a more natural interaction which allows for such interruptions, we propose an audio processing pipeline for filtering out robot's ego speech using only a single-channel microphone. This pipeline takes advantage of the possibility to feed the robot ego speech signal, generated by a text-to-speech API, as training data into a machine learning model. The proposed pipeline combines a convolutional neural network and spectral subtraction to extract overlapping human speech from the audio recorded by the robot-embedded microphone. When evaluating on a held-out test set, we find that this pipeline outperforms our previous approach to this task, as well as state-of-the-art target speech extraction systems that were retrained on the same dataset. We have also integrated the proposed pipeline into a lightweight robot software development framework to make it available for broader use. As a step towards demonstrating the feasibility of deploying our pipeline, we use this framework to evaluate the effectiveness of the pipeline in a small lab-based feasibility pilot using the social robot Pepper. Our results show that when participants interrupt the robot, the pipeline can extract the participant's speech from one-second streaming audio buffers received by the robot-embedded single-channel microphone, hence in near-real time.

## LibriTTS-P: A Corpus with Speaking Style and Speaker Identity Prompts for Text-to-Speech and Style Captioning

- **Abstract**: The advent of immersive Virtual Reality applications has transformed various domains, yet their integration with advanced artificial intelligence technologies like Visual Language Models remains underexplored. This study introduces a pioneering approach utilizing VLMs within VR environments to enhance user interaction and task efficiency. Leveraging the Unity engine and a custom-developed VLM, our system facilitates real-time, intuitive user interactions through natural language processing, without relying on visual text instructions. The incorporation of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies allows for seamless communication between the user and the VLM, enabling the system to guide users through complex tasks effectively. Preliminary experimental results indicate that utilizing VLMs not only reduces task completion times but also improves user comfort and task engagement compared to traditional VR interaction methods.

## VALL-E R: Robust and Efficient Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis via Monotonic Alignment
- **Authors**: Bing Han et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2406.07855](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07855)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Audio language models have recently emerged as a promising approach for various audio generation tasks, relying on audio tokenizers to encode waveforms into sequences of discrete symbols. Audio tokenization often poses a necessary compromise between code bitrate and reconstruction accuracy. When dealing with low-bitrate audio codes, language models are constrained to process only a subset of the information embedded in the audio, which in turn restricts their generative capabilities. To circumvent these issues, we propose encoding audio as vector sequences in continuous space $\mathbb R^d$ and autoregressively generating these sequences using a decoder-only diffusion transformer (ARDiT). Our findings indicate that ARDiT excels in zero-shot text-to-speech and exhibits performance that compares to or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models. High-bitrate continuous speech representation enables almost flawless reconstruction, allowing our model to achieve nearly perfect speech editing. Our experiments reveal that employing Integral Kullback-Leibler (IKL) divergence for distillation at each autoregressive step significantly boosts the perceived quality of the samples. Simultaneously, it condenses the iterative sampling process of the diffusion model into a single step. Furthermore, ARDiT can be trained to predict several continuous vectors in one step, significantly reducing latency during sampling. Impressively, one of our models can generate $170$ ms of $24$ kHz speech per evaluation step with minimal degradation in performance. Audio samples are available at http://ardit-tts.github.io/ .

## EmoSphere-TTS: Emotional Style and Intensity Modeling via Spherical Emotion Vector for Controllable Emotional Text-to-Speech

- **Abstract**: The increasing realism of synthetic speech, driven by advancements in text-to-speech models, raises ethical concerns regarding impersonation and disinformation. Audio watermarking offers a promising solution via embedding human-imperceptible watermarks into AI-generated audios. However, the robustness of audio watermarking against common/adversarial perturbations remains understudied. We present AudioMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the robustness of audio watermarking against watermark removal and watermark forgery. AudioMarkBench includes a new dataset created from Common-Voice across languages, biological sexes, and ages, 3 state-of-the-art watermarking methods, and 15 types of perturbations. We benchmark the robustness of these methods against the perturbations in no-box, black-box, and white-box settings. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of current watermarking techniques and emphasize the need for more robust and fair audio watermarking solutions. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/moyangkuo/AudioMarkBench.
