- **Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and development of audio codecs greatly propel the zero-shot TTS. They can synthesize personalized speech with only a 3-second speech of an unseen speaker as acoustic prompt. However, they only support short speech prompts and cannot leverage longer context information, as required in audiobook and conversational TTS scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio codec-based TTS model to adapt context features with multiple enhancements. Inspired by the success of Qformer, we propose a multi-modal context-enhanced Qformer (MMCE-Qformer) to utilize additional multi-modal context information. Besides, we adapt a pretrained LLM to leverage its understanding ability to predict semantic tokens, and use a SoundStorm to generate acoustic tokens thereby enhancing audio quality and speaker similarity. The extensive objective and subjective evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across various context TTS scenarios.

## UniAudio 1.5: Large Language Model-driven Audio Codec is A Few-shot Audio Task Learner

- **Tags**: zero-shot, multilingual, llm-based
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we propose Phoneme Discretized Saliency Maps (PDSM), a discretization algorithm for saliency maps that takes advantage of phoneme boundaries for explainable detection of AI-generated voice. We experimentally show with two different Text-to-Speech systems (i.e., Tacotron2 and Fastspeech2) that the proposed algorithm produces saliency maps that result in more faithful explanations compared to standard posthoc explanation methods. Moreover, by associating the saliency maps to the phoneme representations, this methodology generates explanations that tend to be more understandable than standard saliency maps on magnitude spectrograms.

## MMM: Multi-Layer Multi-Residual Multi-Stream Discrete Speech Representation from Self-supervised Learning Model

- **Abstract**: This paper introduces VALL-E 2, the latest advancement in neural codec language models that marks a milestone in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), achieving human parity for the first time. Based on its predecessor, VALL-E, the new iteration introduces two significant enhancements: Repetition Aware Sampling refines the original nucleus sampling process by accounting for token repetition in the decoding history. It not only stabilizes the decoding but also circumvents the infinite loop issue. Grouped Code Modeling organizes codec codes into groups to effectively shorten the sequence length, which not only boosts inference speed but also addresses the challenges of long sequence modeling. Our experiments on the LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets show that VALL-E 2 surpasses previous systems in speech robustness, naturalness, and speaker similarity. It is the first of its kind to reach human parity on these benchmarks. Moreover, VALL-E 2 consistently synthesizes high-quality speech, even for sentences that are traditionally challenging due to their complexity or repetitive phrases. The advantages of this work could contribute to valuable endeavors, such as generating speech for individuals with aphasia or people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
