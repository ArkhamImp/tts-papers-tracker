## Quran-MD: A Fine-Grained Multilingual Multimodal Dataset of the Quran

- **Abstract**: We present Quran MD, a comprehensive multimodal dataset of the Quran that integrates textual, linguistic, and audio dimensions at the verse and word levels. For each verse (ayah), the dataset provides its original Arabic text, English translation, and phonetic transliteration. To capture the rich oral tradition of Quranic recitation, we include verse-level audio from 32 distinct reciters, reflecting diverse recitation styles and dialectical nuances. At the word level, each token is paired with its corresponding Arabic script, English translation, transliteration, and an aligned audio recording, allowing fine-grained analysis of pronunciation, phonology, and semantic context. This dataset supports various applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, linguistic analysis, and digital Islamic studies. Bridging text and audio modalities across multiple reciters, this dataset provides a unique resource to advance computational approaches to Quranic recitation and study. Beyond enabling tasks such as ASR, tajweed detection, and Quranic TTS, it lays the foundation for multimodal embeddings, semantic retrieval, style transfer, and personalized tutoring systems that can support both research and community applications.

## AR-Omni: A Unified Autoregressive Model for Any-to-Any Generation

- **Abstract**: Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.
