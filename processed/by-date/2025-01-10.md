- **Abstract**: Controlling text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize speech with the prosodic characteristics expected by users has attracted much attention. To achieve controllability, current studies focus on two main directions: (1) using reference speech as prosody prompt to guide speech synthesis, and (2) using natural language descriptions to control the generation process. However, finding reference speech that exactly contains the prosody that users want to synthesize takes a lot of effort. Description-based guidance in TTS systems can only determine the overall prosody, which has difficulty in achieving fine-grained prosody control over the synthesized speech. In this paper, we propose DrawSpeech, a sketch-conditioned diffusion model capable of generating speech based on any prosody sketches drawn by users. Specifically, the prosody sketches are fed to DrawSpeech to provide a rough indication of the expected prosody trends. DrawSpeech then recovers the detailed pitch and energy contours based on the coarse sketches and synthesizes the desired speech. Experimental results show that DrawSpeech can generate speech with a wide variety of prosody and can precisely control the fine-grained prosody in a user-friendly manner. Our implementation and audio samples are publicly available.

## MinMo: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Seamless Voice Interaction

- **Abstract**: Codec-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have shown impressive quality with zero-shot voice cloning abilities. However, they often struggle with more expressive references or complex text inputs. We present MARS6, a robust encoder-decoder transformer for rapid, expressive TTS. MARS6 is built on recent improvements in spoken language modelling. Utilizing a hierarchical setup for its decoder, new speech tokens are processed at a rate of only 12 Hz, enabling efficient modelling of long-form text while retaining reconstruction quality. We combine several recent training and inference techniques to reduce repetitive generation and improve output stability and quality. This enables the 70M-parameter MARS6 to achieve similar performance to models many times larger. We show this in objective and subjective evaluations, comparing TTS output quality and reference speaker cloning ability. Project page: https://camb-ai.github.io/mars6-turbo/

## PROEMO: Prompt-Driven Text-to-Speech Synthesis Based on Emotion and Intensity Control

- **Abstract**: Contemporary text-to-speech solutions for accessibility applications can typically be classified into two categories: (i) device-based statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) or unit selection (USEL) and (ii) cloud-based neural TTS. SPSS and USEL offer low latency and low disk footprint at the expense of naturalness and audio quality. Cloud-based neural TTS systems provide significantly better audio quality and naturalness but regress in terms of latency and responsiveness, rendering these impractical for real-world applications. More recently, neural TTS models were made deployable to run on handheld devices. Nevertheless, latency remains higher than SPSS and USEL, while disk footprint prohibits pre-installation for multiple voices at once. In this work, we describe a high-quality compact neural TTS system achieving latency on the order of 15 ms with low disk footprint. The proposed solution is capable of running on low-power devices.

## Low-Resource Text-to-Speech Synthesis Using Noise-Augmented Training of ForwardTacotron

- **Abstract**: While autoregressive speech token generation models produce speech with remarkable variety and naturalness, their inherent lack of controllability often results in issues such as hallucinations and undesired vocalizations that do not conform to conditioning inputs. We introduce Koel-TTS, a suite of enhanced encoder-decoder Transformer TTS models that address these challenges by incorporating preference alignment techniques guided by automatic speech recognition and speaker verification models. Additionally, we incorporate classifier-free guidance to further improve synthesis adherence to the transcript and reference speaker audio. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizations significantly enhance target speaker similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness of synthesized speech. Notably, Koel-TTS directly maps text and context audio to acoustic tokens, and on the aforementioned metrics, outperforms state-of-the-art TTS models, despite being trained on a significantly smaller dataset. Audio samples and demos are available on our website.

## MARS6: A Small and Robust Hierarchical-Codec Text-to-Speech Model

- **Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting-based talking head synthesis has recently gained attention for its ability to render high-fidelity images with real-time inference speed. However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.
