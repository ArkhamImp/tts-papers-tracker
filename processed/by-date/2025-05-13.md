- **Abstract**: This paper reports the construction of the Teochew-Wild, a speech corpus of the Teochew dialect. The corpus includes 18.9 hours of in-the-wild Teochew speech data from multiple speakers, covering both formal and colloquial expressions, with precise orthographic and pinyin annotations. Additionally, we provide supplementary text processing tools and resources to propel research and applications in speech tasks for this low-resource language, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available Teochew dataset with accurate orthographic annotations. We conduct experiments on the corpus, and the results validate its effectiveness in ASR and TTS tasks.

- **Abstract**: We introduce MiniMax-Speech, an autoregressive Transformer-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that generates high-quality speech. A key innovation is our learnable speaker encoder, which extracts timbre features from a reference audio without requiring its transcription. This enables MiniMax-Speech to produce highly expressive speech with timbre consistent with the reference in a zero-shot manner, while also supporting one-shot voice cloning with exceptionally high similarity to the reference voice. In addition, the overall quality of the synthesized audio is enhanced through the proposed Flow-VAE. Our model supports 32 languages and demonstrates excellent performance across multiple objective and subjective evaluations metrics. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on objective voice cloning metrics (Word Error Rate and Speaker Similarity) and has secured the top position on the public TTS Arena leaderboard. Another key strength of MiniMax-Speech, granted by the robust and disentangled representations from the speaker encoder, is its extensibility without modifying the base model, enabling various applications such as: arbitrary voice emotion control via LoRA; text to voice (T2V) by synthesizing timbre features directly from text description; and professional voice cloning (PVC) by fine-tuning timbre features with additional data.
