- **Abstract**: In recent years, speech diffusion models have advanced rapidly. Alongside the widely used U-Net architecture, transformer-based models such as the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have also gained attention. However, current DiT speech models treat Mel spectrograms as general images, which overlooks the specific acoustic properties of speech. To address these limitations, we propose a method called Directional Patch Interaction for Text-to-Speech (DPI-TTS), which builds on DiT and achieves fast training without compromising accuracy. Notably, DPI-TTS employs a low-to-high frequency, frame-by-frame progressive inference approach that aligns more closely with acoustic properties, enhancing the naturalness of the generated speech. Additionally, we introduce a fine-grained style temporal modeling method that further improves speaker style similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method increases the training speed by nearly 2 times and significantly outperforms the baseline models.

## A Framework for Synthetic Audio Conversations Generation using Large Language Models
- **Authors**: Kaung Myat Kyaw et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2409.00946](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00946)
- **Tags**: multilingual, llm-based
- **Abstract**: Second language (L2) learners can improve their pronunciation by imitating golden speech, especially when the speech that aligns with their respective speech characteristics. This study explores the hypothesis that learner-specific golden speech generated with zero-shot text-to-speech (ZS-TTS) techniques can be harnessed as an effective metric for measuring the pronunciation proficiency of L2 learners. Building on this exploration, the contributions of this study are at least two-fold: 1) design and development of a systematic framework for assessing the ability of a synthesis model to generate golden speech, and 2) in-depth investigations of the effectiveness of using golden speech in automatic pronunciation assessment (APA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on the L2-ARCTIC and Speechocean762 benchmark datasets suggest that our proposed modeling can yield significant performance improvements with respect to various assessment metrics in relation to some prior arts. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the role of golden speech in both ZS-TTS and APA, offering a promising regime for computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT).

## SoCodec: A Semantic-Ordered Multi-Stream Speech Codec for Efficient Language Model Based Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Haohan Guo et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2409.00933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00933)
- **Tags**: multilingual, codec, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces Easy One-Step Text-to-Speech (E1 TTS), an efficient non-autoregressive zero-shot text-to-speech system based on denoising diffusion pretraining and distribution matching distillation. The training of E1 TTS is straightforward; it does not require explicit monotonic alignment between the text and audio pairs. The inference of E1 TTS is efficient, requiring only one neural network evaluation for each utterance. Despite its sampling efficiency, E1 TTS achieves naturalness and speaker similarity comparable to various strong baseline models. Audio samples are available at http://e1tts.github.io/ .
