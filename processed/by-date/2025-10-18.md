- **Abstract**: High-fidelity digital humans are increasingly used in interactive applications, yet achieving both visual realism and real-time responsiveness remains a major challenge. We present a high-fidelity, real-time conversational digital human system that seamlessly combines a visually realistic 3D avatar, persona-driven expressive speech synthesis, and knowledge-grounded dialogue generation. To support natural and timely interaction, we introduce an asynchronous execution pipeline that coordinates multi-modal components with minimal latency. The system supports advanced features such as wake word detection, emotionally expressive prosody, and highly accurate, context-aware response generation. It leverages novel retrieval-augmented methods, including history augmentation to maintain conversational flow and intent-based routing for efficient knowledge access. Together, these components form an integrated system that enables responsive and believable digital humans, suitable for immersive applications in communication, education, and entertainment.
