- **Abstract**: Text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved impressive results for widely spoken languages, yet many under-resourced languages remain challenged by limited data and linguistic complexities. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that integrates a data-optimized framework with an advanced acoustic model to build high-quality TTS systems for low-resource scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Thai as an illustrative case, where intricate phonetic rules and sparse resources are effectively addressed. Our method enables zero-shot voice cloning and improved performance across diverse client applications, ranging from finance to healthcare, education, and law. Extensive evaluations - both subjective and objective - confirm that our model meets state-of-the-art standards, offering a scalable solution for TTS production in data-limited settings, with significant implications for broader industry adoption and multilingual accessibility.

- **Abstract**: Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.
