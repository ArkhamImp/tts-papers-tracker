- **Abstract**: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

## Arabic TTS with FastPitch: Reproducible Baselines, Adversarial Training, and Oversmoothing Analysis
- **Authors**: Lars Nippert et.al.

- **Tags**: streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models have positioned them as powerful generative frameworks for speech synthesis, demonstrating substantial improvements in audio quality and stability. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in vocoders conditioned on mel spectrograms remains constrained, particularly when the conditioning diverges from the training distribution. The recently proposed GLA-Grad model introduced a phase-aware extension to the WaveGrad vocoder that integrated the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA) into the reverse process to reduce inconsistencies between generated signals and conditioning mel spectrogram. In this paper, we further improve GLA-Grad through an innovative choice in how to apply the correction. Particularly, we compute the correction term only once, with a single application of GLA, to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline models, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.
