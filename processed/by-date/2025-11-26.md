- **Abstract**: College students often face academic challenges that hamper their productivity and well-being. Although self-help books and productivity apps are popular, they often fall short. Books provide generalized, non-interactive guidance, and apps are not inherently educational and can hinder the development of key organizational skills. Traditional productivity coaching offers personalized support, but is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept for a socially assistive robot (SAR) as an educational coach and a potential solution to the limitations of existing productivity tools and coaching approaches. The SAR delivers six different lessons on time management and task prioritization. Users interact via a chat interface, while the SAR responds through speech (with a toggle option). An integrated dashboard monitors progress, mood, engagement, confidence per lesson, and time spent per lesson. It also offers personalized productivity insights to foster reflection and self-awareness. We evaluated the system with 15 college students, achieving a System Usability Score of 79.2 and high ratings for overall experience and engagement. Our findings suggest that SAR-based productivity coaching can offer an effective and scalable solution to improve productivity among college students.

- **Abstract**: Safeguard models help large language models (LLMs) detect and block harmful content, but most evaluations remain English-centric and overlook linguistic and cultural diversity. Existing multilingual safety benchmarks often rely on machine-translated English data, which fails to capture nuances in low-resource languages. Southeast Asian (SEA) languages are underrepresented despite the region's linguistic diversity and unique safety concerns, from culturally sensitive political speech to region-specific misinformation. Addressing these gaps requires benchmarks that are natively authored to reflect local norms and harm scenarios. We introduce SEA-SafeguardBench, the first human-verified safety benchmark for SEA, covering eight languages, 21,640 samples, across three subsets: general, in-the-wild, and content generation. The experimental results from our benchmark demonstrate that even state-of-the-art LLMs and guardrails are challenged by SEA cultural and harm scenarios and underperform when compared to English texts.

- **Abstract**: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices. In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.

- **Abstract**: Neural audio codecs have gained recent popularity for their use in generative modeling as they offer high-fidelity audio reconstruction at low bitrates. While human listening studies remain the gold standard for assessing perceptual quality, they are time-consuming and impractical. In this work, we examine the reliability of existing objective quality metrics in assessing the performance of recent neural audio codecs. To this end, we conduct a MUSHRA listening test on high-fidelity speech signals and analyze the correlation between subjective scores and widely used objective metrics. Our results show that, while some metrics align well with human perception, others struggle to capture relevant distortions. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate evaluation metrics when using neural audio codecs for speech.

## Multi-Reward GRPO for Stable and Prosodic Single-Codebook TTS LLMs at Scale

- **Abstract**: Zero-shot ASR for Arabic remains challenging: while multilingual models perform well on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), error rates rise sharply on dialectal and accented speech due to linguistic mismatch and scarce labeled data. We study context-aware decoding as a lightweight test-time adaptation paradigm that conditions inference on external side information without parameter updates. For promptable encoder-decoder ASR (e.g., Whisper), we incorporate context through (i) decoder prompting with first-pass hypotheses and (ii) encoder/decoder prefixing with retrieved speech-text exemplars, complemented by simple prompt reordering and optional speaker-matched synthetic exemplars to improve robustness in informal and multi-speaker settings. To extend contextual adaptation beyond promptable architectures, we introduce proxy-guided n-best selection for CTC ASR: given one or more external proxy hypotheses, we select from a model's n-best list by minimizing text-level distance to the proxies, enabling contextual inference without direct prompting. Across ten Arabic conditions spanning MSA, accented MSA, and multiple dialects, context-aware decoding yields average relative WER reductions of 22.29% on MSA, 20.54 on accented MSA, and 9.15% on dialectal Arabic. For CTC models, proxy-guided selection reduces WER by 15.6% relative on MSA and recovers a substantial fraction of oracle n-best gains, demonstrating that context-aware inference generalizes beyond encoder-decoder ASR.

- **Abstract**: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.

## RosettaSpeech: Zero-Shot Speech-to-Speech Translation from Monolingual Data

- **Abstract**: Human voice encodes both identity and paralinguistic cues, yet encoders in large audio-language models (LALMs) rarely balance both aspects. In this work, we present a study toward building a general-purpose voice encoder that captures nuanced voice cues. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we find that multi-task training yields the most balanced representations, whereas contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) primarily improves retrieval without enhancing paralinguistic understanding. Our final encoder, Auden-Voice, also demonstrates strong performance when integrated with LLMs. The code and training recipes will be released with the audio understanding toolkit Auden.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications.

- **Abstract**: Speech-LLM models have demonstrated great performance in multi-modal and multi-task speech understanding. A typical speech-LLM paradigm is integrating speech modality with a large language model (LLM). While the Whisper encoder was frequently adopted in previous studies for speech input, it shows limitations regarding input format, model scale, and semantic performance. To this end, we propose a lightweight TTA model specialized in speech semantics for more effective LLM integration. With large-scale training of 358k hours of speech data on multilingual speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST) and speech-text alignment tasks, TTA is capable of producing robust cross-lingual speech representations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including ASR/ST, speech retrieval, and ASR-LLM performance assessments, demonstrate TTA's superiority over Whisper. Furthermore, we rigorously validate the interplay between cross-lingual capabilities and ASR/ST performance. The model weights and training recipes of TTA will be released as part of an audio understanding toolkit Auden.
