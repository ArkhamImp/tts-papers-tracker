- **Abstract**: Current speech generation research can be categorized into two primary classes: non-autoregressive and autoregressive. The fundamental distinction between these approaches lies in the duration prediction strategy employed for predictable-length sequences. The NAR methods ensure stability in speech generation by explicitly and independently modeling the duration of each phonetic unit. Conversely, AR methods employ an autoregressive paradigm to predict the compressed speech token by implicitly modeling duration with Markov properties. Although this approach improves prosody, it does not provide the structural guarantees necessary for stability. To simultaneously address the issues of stability and naturalness in speech generation, we propose FlexSpeech, a stable, controllable, and expressive TTS model. The motivation behind FlexSpeech is to incorporate Markov dependencies and preference optimization directly on the duration predictor to boost its naturalness while maintaining explicit modeling of the phonetic units to ensure stability. Specifically, we decompose the speech generation task into two components: an AR duration predictor and a NAR acoustic model. The acoustic model is trained on a substantial amount of data to learn to render audio more stably, given reference audio prosody and phone durations. The duration predictor is optimized in a lightweight manner for different stylistic variations, thereby enabling rapid style transfer while maintaining a decoupled relationship with the specified speaker timbre. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves SOTA stability and naturalness in zero-shot TTS. More importantly, when transferring to a specific stylistic domain, we can accomplish lightweight optimization of the duration module solely with about 100 data samples, without the need to adjust the acoustic model, thereby enabling rapid and stable style transfer.

## Dopamine Audiobook: A Training-free MLLM Agent for Emotional and Human-like Audiobook Generation

- **Tags**: expressive, llm-based
- **Abstract**: Novice content creators often invest significant time recording expressive speech for social media videos. While recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) technology can generate highly realistic speech in various languages and accents, many struggle with unintuitive or overly granular TTS interfaces. We propose simplifying TTS generation by allowing users to specify high-level context alongside their script. Our Wizard-of-Oz system, SpeakEasy, leverages user-provided context to inform and influence TTS output, enabling iterative refinement with high-level feedback. This approach was informed by two 8-subject formative studies: one examining content creators' experiences with TTS, and the other drawing on effective strategies from voice actors. Our evaluation shows that participants using SpeakEasy were more successful in generating performances matching their personal standards, without requiring significantly more effort than leading industry interfaces.

## Generalized Audio Deepfake Detection Using Frame-level Latent Information Entropy

- **Abstract**: We introduce SIFT (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), a 50M-example dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of speech-text large language models (LLMs). SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs.
