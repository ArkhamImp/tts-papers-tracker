- **Abstract**: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) has seen remarkable advancements in recent years. However, compared to speech and general audio data, publicly available singing datasets remain limited. In practice, this data scarcity often leads to performance degradation in long-tail scenarios, such as imbalanced pitch distributions or rare singing styles. To mitigate these challenges, we propose uncertainty-based optimization to improve the training process of end-to-end SVS models. First, we introduce differentiable data augmentation in the adversarial training, which operates in a sample-wise manner to increase the prior uncertainty. Second, we incorporate a frame-level uncertainty prediction module that estimates the posterior uncertainty, enabling the model to allocate more learning capacity to low-confidence segments. Empirical results on the Opencpop and Ofuton-P, across Chinese and Japanese, demonstrate that our approach improves performance in various perspectives.

- **Abstract**: As an endangered language, Manchu presents unique challenges for speech synthesis, including severe data scarcity and strong phonological agglutination. This paper proposes ManchuTTS(Manchu Text to Speech), a novel approach tailored to Manchu's linguistic characteristics. To handle agglutination, this method designs a three-tier text representation (phoneme, syllable, prosodic) and a cross-modal hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-granular alignment. The synthesis model integrates deep convolutional networks with a flow-matching Transformer, enabling efficient, non-autoregressive generation. This method further introduce a hierarchical contrastive loss to guide structured acoustic-linguistic correspondence. To address low-resource constraints, This method construct the first Manchu TTS dataset and employ a data augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that ManchuTTS attains a MOS of 4.52 using a 5.2-hour training subset derived from our full 6.24-hour annotated corpus, outperforming all baseline models by a notable margin. Ablations confirm hierarchical guidance improves agglutinative word pronunciation accuracy (AWPA) by 31% and prosodic naturalness by 27%.
