- **Abstract**: Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) plays a pivotal role in fine-grained timbre modeling for speech generation tasks. However, it remains challenging due to the inherently subjective nature of timbre descriptors and the severe label imbalance in existing datasets. In this work, we present QvTAD, a novel pairwise comparison framework based on differential attention, designed to enhance the modeling of perceptual timbre attributes. To address the label imbalance in the VCTK-RVA dataset, we introduce a graph-based data augmentation strategy that constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph and employs Disjoint-Set Union techniques to automatically mine unobserved utterance pairs with valid attribute comparisons. Our framework leverages speaker embeddings from a pretrained FACodec, and incorporates a Relative Timbre Shift-Aware Differential Attention module. This module explicitly models attribute-specific contrasts between paired utterances via differential denoising and contrast amplification mechanisms. Experimental results on the VCTK-RVA benchmark demonstrate that QvTAD achieves substantial improvements across multiple timbre descriptors, with particularly notable gains in cross-speaker generalization scenarios.

## DarkStream: real-time speech anonymization with low latency

- **Abstract**: We introduce ParCzech4Speech 1.0, a processed version of the ParCzech 4.0 corpus, targeted at speech modeling tasks with the largest variant containing 2,695 hours. We combined the sound recordings of the Czech parliamentary speeches with the official transcripts. The recordings were processed with WhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our processing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The dataset is available in the LINDAT repository, with the sentence-segmented and unsegmented variants additionally available on Hugging Face.

## AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds

- **Abstract**: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii) Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender inclinations.

## Open-Source Full-Duplex Conversational Datasets for Natural and Interactive Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without compromising synthesis quality.

## LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume, and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2% F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p &lt; 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural French speech. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hi-paris/Prosody-Control-French-TTS.

- **Abstract**: In the era of big data, remarkable advancements have been achieved in personalized speech generation techniques that utilize speaker attributes, including voice and speaking style, to generate deepfake speech. This has also amplified global security risks from deepfake speech misuse, resulting in considerable societal costs worldwide. To address the security threats posed by deepfake speech, techniques have been developed focusing on both the protection of voice attributes and the defense against deepfake speech. Among them, the voice anonymization technique has been developed to protect voice attributes from extraction for deepfake generation, while deepfake detection and watermarking have been utilized to defend against the misuse of deepfake speech. This paper provides a short and concise overview of the three techniques, describing the methodologies, advancements, and challenges. A comprehensive version, offering additional discussions, will be published in the near future.
