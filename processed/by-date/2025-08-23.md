- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations. Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

- **Abstract**: Voice deepfake attacks, which artificially impersonate human speech for malicious purposes, have emerged as a severe threat. Existing defenses typically inject noise into human speech to compromise voice encoders in speech synthesis models. However, these methods degrade audio quality and require prior knowledge of the attack approaches, limiting their effectiveness in diverse scenarios. Moreover, real-time audios, such as speech in virtual meetings and voice messages, are still exposed to voice deepfake threats. To overcome these limitations, we propose ClearMask, a noise-free defense mechanism against voice deepfake attacks. Unlike traditional approaches, ClearMask modifies the audio mel-spectrogram by selectively filtering certain frequencies, inducing a transferable voice feature loss without injecting noise. We then apply audio style transfer to further deceive voice decoders while preserving perceived sound quality. Finally, optimized reverberation is introduced to disrupt the output of voice generation models without affecting the naturalness of the speech. Additionally, we develop LiveMask to protect streaming speech in real-time through a universal frequency filter and reverberation generator. Our experimental results show that ClearMask and LiveMask effectively prevent voice deepfake attacks from deceiving speaker verification models and human listeners, even for unseen voice synthesis models and black-box API services. Furthermore, ClearMask demonstrates resilience against adaptive attackers who attempt to recover the original audio signal from the protected speech samples.
