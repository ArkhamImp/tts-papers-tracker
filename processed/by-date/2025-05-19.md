- **Tags**: multilingual, llm-based
- **Abstract**: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.

- **Abstract**: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to align synthesized speech with the emotional and stylistic context of user-agent interactions to achieve empathy. Current generative CSS models face interpretability limitations due to insufficient emotional perception and redundant discrete speech coding. To address the above issues, we present Chain-Talker, a three-stage framework mimicking human cognition: Emotion Understanding derives context-aware emotion descriptors from dialogue history; Semantic Understanding generates compact semantic codes via serialized prediction; and Empathetic Rendering synthesizes expressive speech by integrating both components. To support emotion modeling, we develop CSS-EmCap, an LLM-driven automated pipeline for generating precise conversational speech emotion captions. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Chain-Talker produces more expressive and empathetic speech than existing methods, with CSS-EmCap contributing to reliable emotion modeling. The code and demos are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Chain-Talker.

## Codec-Based Deepfake Source Tracing via Neural Audio Codec Taxonomy

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability. Our audio samples are publicly available.

## OZSpeech: One-step Zero-shot Speech Synthesis with Learned-Prior-Conditioned Flow Matching
- **Authors**: Hieu-Nghia Huynh-Nguyen et.al.

- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Current movie dubbing technology can produce the desired speech using a reference voice and input video, maintaining perfect synchronization with the visuals while effectively conveying the intended emotions. However, crucial aspects of movie dubbing, including adaptation to various dubbing styles, effective handling of dialogue, narration, and monologues, as well as consideration of subtle details such as speaker age and gender, remain insufficiently explored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal generative framework. First, it utilizes a multi-modal large vision-language model (VLM) to analyze visual inputs, enabling the recognition of dubbing types and fine-grained attributes. Second, it produces high-quality dubbing using large speech generation models, guided by multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a movie dubbing dataset with annotations for dubbing types and subtle details is constructed to enhance movie understanding and improve dubbing quality for the proposed multi-modal framework. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In details, the LSE-D, SPK-SIM, EMO-SIM, and MCD exhibit improvements of up to 1.09%, 8.80%, 19.08%, and 18.74%, respectively.

## RoVo: Robust Voice Protection Against Unauthorized Speech Synthesis with Embedding-Level Perturbations

- **Abstract**: In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN), a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics, and exhibits increased robustness in synthesized audio.

- **Abstract**: We introduce Vox-Profile, a comprehensive benchmark to characterize rich speaker and speech traits using speech foundation models. Unlike existing works that focus on a single dimension of speaker traits, Vox-Profile provides holistic and multi-dimensional profiles that reflect both static speaker traits (e.g., age, sex, accent) and dynamic speech properties (e.g., emotion, speech flow). This benchmark is grounded in speech science and linguistics, developed with domain experts to accurately index speaker and speech characteristics. We report benchmark experiments using over 15 publicly available speech datasets and several widely used speech foundation models that target various static and dynamic speaker and speech properties. In addition to benchmark experiments, we showcase several downstream applications supported by Vox-Profile. First, we show that Vox-Profile can augment existing speech recognition datasets to analyze ASR performance variability. Vox-Profile is also used as a tool to evaluate the performance of speech generation systems. Finally, we assess the quality of our automated profiles through comparison with human evaluation and show convergent validity. Vox-Profile is publicly available at: https://github.com/tiantiaf0627/vox-profile-release.
