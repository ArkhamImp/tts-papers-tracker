- **Abstract**: Current speech production systems predominantly rely on large transformer models that operate as black boxes, providing little interpretability or grounding in the physical mechanisms of human speech. We address this limitation by proposing a new framework: speech generation through explicit articulatory control. This reframes speech as a motor control task similar to robotic manipulation. Our approach uses reinforcement learning to train a policy that directly controls the movements of vocal tract articulators, such as the tongue, lips, and jaw, to produce syllable-level speech. Specifically, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to learn optimal articulatory movements based on acoustic feedback provided by our audio perceiver, Sylber. The resulting articulatory trajectories are decoded into audio using SPARC, a pre-trained articulatory-to-speech decoder. We train this framework on six target syllables, and it demonstrates successful convergence, with similarity scores between the policy-generated audio and the target syllables exceeding 0.85. Accurate human transcription of the audio for syllables such as "please", "loot", and "cat" demonstrates the intelligibility of this framework.
