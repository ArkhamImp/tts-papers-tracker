- **Abstract**: Voice conversion (VC) stands as a crucial research area in speech synthesis, enabling the transformation of a speaker's vocal characteristics to resemble another while preserving the linguistic content. This technology has broad applications, including automated movie dubbing, speech-to-singing conversion, and assistive devices for pathological speech rehabilitation. With the increasing demand for high-quality and natural-sounding synthetic voices, researchers have developed a wide range of VC techniques. Among these, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approaches have drawn considerable attention for their powerful feature-mapping capabilities and potential to produce highly realistic speech. Despite notable advancements, challenges such as ensuring training stability, maintaining linguistic consistency, and achieving perceptual naturalness continue to hinder progress in GAN-based VC systems. This systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis of the voice conversion landscape, highlighting key techniques, key challenges, and the transformative impact of GANs in the field. The survey categorizes existing methods, examines technical obstacles, and critically evaluates recent developments in GAN-based VC. By consolidating and synthesizing research findings scattered across the literature, this review provides a structured understanding of the strengths and limitations of different approaches. The significance of this survey lies in its ability to guide future research by identifying existing gaps, proposing potential directions, and offering insights for building more robust and efficient VC systems. Overall, this work serves as an essential resource for researchers, developers, and practitioners aiming to advance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in voice conversion technology.

## SpeakEasy: Enhancing Text-to-Speech Interactions for Expressive Content Creation

- **Abstract**: Voice conversion (VC) has made progress in feature disentanglement, but it is still difficult to balance timbre and content information. This paper evaluates the pre-trained model features commonly used in voice conversion, and proposes an innovative method for disentangling speech feature representations. Specifically, we first propose an ideal content feature, referred to as the average feature, which is calculated by averaging the features within frame-level aligned parallel speech (FAPS) data. For generating FAPS data, we utilize a technique that involves freezing the duration predictor in a Text-to-Speech system and manipulating speaker embedding. To fit the average feature on traditional VC datasets, we then design the AVENet to take features as input and generate closely matching average features. Experiments are conducted on the performance of AVENet-extracted features within a VC system. The experimental results demonstrate its superiority over multiple current speech feature disentangling methods. These findings affirm the effectiveness of our disentanglement approach.
