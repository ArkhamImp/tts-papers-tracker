- **Abstract**: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%, and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration processes.

## EmoSSLSphere: Multilingual Emotional Speech Synthesis with Spherical Vectors and Discrete Speech Tokens

- **Abstract**: Business interview preparation demands both solid theoretical grounding and refined soft skills, yet conventional classroom methods rarely deliver the individualized, culturally aware practice employers currently expect. This paper introduces SimInterview, a large language model (LLM)-based simulated multilingual interview training system designed for business professionals entering the AI-transformed labor market. Our system leverages an LLM agent and synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across multiple languages. Built on LLMs (OpenAI o3, Llama 4 Maverick, Gemma 3), integrated with Whisper speech recognition, GPT-SoVITS voice synthesis, Ditto diffusion-based talking head generation model, and ChromaDB vector databases, our system significantly improves interview readiness across English and Japanese markets. Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging regulatory expectations.

## Training-Free Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration

- **Abstract**: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional style of speech while preserving its linguistic content. In practical EVC, controllability, the ability to independently control speaker identity and emotional style using distinct references, is crucial. However, existing methods often struggle to fully disentangle these attributes and lack the ability to model fine-grained emotional expressions such as temporal dynamics. We propose Maestro-EVC, a controllable EVC framework that enables independent control of content, speaker identity, and emotion by effectively disentangling each attribute from separate references. We further introduce a temporal emotion representation and an explicit prosody modeling with prosody augmentation to robustly capture and transfer the temporal dynamics of the target emotion, even under prosody-mismatched conditions. Experimental results confirm that Maestro-EVC achieves high-quality, controllable, and emotionally expressive speech synthesis.

## MultiAiTutor: Child-Friendly Educational Multilingual Speech Generation Tutor with LLMs

- **Abstract**: Dysarthric speakers experience substantial communication challenges due to impaired motor control of the speech apparatus, which leads to reduced speech intelligibility. This creates significant obstacles in dataset curation since actual recording of long, articulate sentences for the objective of training personalized TTS models becomes infeasible. Thus, the limited availability of audio data, in addition to the articulation errors that are present within the audio, complicates personalized speech synthesis for target dysarthric speaker adaptation. To address this, we frame the issue as a domain transfer task and introduce a knowledge anchoring framework that leverages a teacher-student model, enhanced by curriculum learning through audio augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed zero-shot multi-speaker TTS model effectively generates synthetic speech with markedly reduced articulation errors and high speaker fidelity, while maintaining prosodic naturalness.

## Fairness in Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Understanding Intrinsic Bias in Dysarthric Speech Cloning using F5-TTS

- **Abstract**: Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model, which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin, integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.
