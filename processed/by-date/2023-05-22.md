- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: Scaling text-to-speech to a large and wild dataset has been proven to be highly effective in achieving timbre and speech style generalization, particularly in zero-shot TTS. However, previous works usually encode speech into latent using audio codec and use autoregressive language models or diffusion models to generate it, which ignores the intrinsic nature of speech and may lead to inferior or uncontrollable results. We argue that speech can be decomposed into several attributes (e.g., content, timbre, prosody, and phase) and each of them should be modeled using a module with appropriate inductive biases. From this perspective, we carefully design a novel and large zero-shot TTS system called Mega-TTS, which is trained with large-scale wild data and models different attributes in different ways: 1) Instead of using latent encoded by audio codec as the intermediate feature, we still choose spectrogram as it separates the phase and other attributes very well. Phase can be appropriately constructed by the GAN-based vocoder and does not need to be modeled by the language model. 2) We model the timbre using global vectors since timbre is a global attribute that changes slowly over time. 3) We further use a VQGAN-based acoustic model to generate the spectrogram and a latent code language model to fit the distribution of prosody, since prosody changes quickly over time in a sentence, and language models can capture both local and long-range dependencies. We scale Mega-TTS to multi-domain datasets with 20K hours of speech and evaluate its performance on unseen speakers. Experimental results demonstrate that Mega-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art TTS systems on zero-shot TTS, speech editing, and cross-lingual TTS tasks, with superior naturalness, robustness, and speaker similarity due to the proper inductive bias of each module.

## U-DiT TTS: U-Diffusion Vision Transformer for Text-to-Speech
- **Authors**: Xin Jing et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2305.13195](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13195)
- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Dynamically synthesizing talking speech that actively responds to a listening head is critical during the face-to-face interaction. For example, the speaker could take advantage of the listener's facial expression to adjust the tones, stressed syllables, or pauses. In this work, we present a new visual-aware text-to-speech (VA-TTS) task to synthesize speech conditioned on both textual inputs and sequential visual feedback (e.g., nod, smile) of the listener in face-to-face communication. Different from traditional text-to-speech, VA-TTS highlights the impact of visual modality. On this newly-minted task, we devise a baseline model to fuse phoneme linguistic information and listener visual signals for speech synthesis. Extensive experiments on multimodal conversation dataset ViCo-X verify our proposal for generating more natural audio with scenario-appropriate rhythm and prosody.

## ViT-TTS: Visual Text-to-Speech with Scalable Diffusion Transformer
- **Authors**: Huadai Liu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2305.12708](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12708)
- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Deep learning has led to considerable advances in text-to-speech synthesis. Most recently, the adoption of Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs), has gained traction due to their ability to produce high-quality synthesized neural speech in neural speech synthesis systems. In SGMs, the U-Net architecture and its variants have long dominated as the backbone since its first successful adoption. In this research, we mainly focus on the neural network in diffusion-model-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems and propose the U-DiT architecture, exploring the potential of vision transformer architecture as the core component of the diffusion models in a TTS system. The modular design of the U-DiT architecture, inherited from the best parts of U-Net and ViT, allows for great scalability and versatility across different data scales. The proposed U-DiT TTS system is a mel spectrogram-based acoustic model and utilizes a pretrained HiFi-GAN as the vocoder. The objective (ie Frechet distance) and MOS results show that our DiT-TTS system achieves state-of-art performance on the single speaker dataset LJSpeech.
