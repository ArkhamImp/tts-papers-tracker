- **Abstract**: In singing voice synthesis (SVS), generating singing voices from musical scores faces challenges due to limited data availability. This study proposes a unique strategy to address the data scarcity in SVS. We employ an existing singing voice synthesizer for data augmentation, complemented by detailed manual tuning, an approach not previously explored in data curation, to reduce instances of unnatural voice synthesis. This innovative method has led to the creation of two expansive singing voice datasets, ACE-Opencpop and ACE-KiSing, which are instrumental for large-scale, multi-singer voice synthesis. Through thorough experimentation, we establish that these datasets not only serve as new benchmarks for SVS but also enhance SVS performance on other singing voice datasets when used as supplementary resources. The corpora, pre-trained models, and their related training recipes are publicly available at ESPnet-Muskits (\url{https://github.com/espnet/espnet})
