- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative. This survey paper provides the first comprehensive overview of recent methodologies for constructing SpeechLMs, detailing the key components of their architecture and the various training recipes integral to their development. Additionally, we systematically survey the various capabilities of SpeechLMs, categorize their evaluation metrics, and discuss the challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

## Fast and High-Quality Auto-Regressive Speech Synthesis via Speculative Decoding
- **Authors**: Bohan Li et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2410.21951](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21951)
- **Tags**: streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Speech recognition and speech synthesis models are typically trained separately, each with its own set of learning objectives, training data, and model parameters, resulting in two distinct large networks. We propose a parameter-efficient approach to learning ASR and TTS jointly via a multi-task learning objective and shared parameters. Our evaluation demonstrates that the performance of our multi-task model is comparable to that of individually trained models while significantly saving computational and memory costs ($\sim$50\% reduction in the total number of parameters required for the two tasks combined). We experiment with English as a resource-rich language, and Arabic as a relatively low-resource language due to shortage of TTS data. Our models are trained with publicly available data, and both the training code and model checkpoints are openly available for further research.

## RDSinger: Reference-based Diffusion Network for Singing Voice Synthesis
- **Authors**: Kehan Sui et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2410.21641](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21641)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: This study introduces a refined approach to Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation that significantly enhances sampling stability across languages, with a particular focus on Hebrew. By leveraging discrete semantic units with higher phonetic correlation obtained from a self-supervised model, our method addresses the inherent instability often encountered in TTS systems, especially those dealing with non-diacriticized scripts like Hebrew. Utilizing HuBERT codes, our model generates discrete representations that are optimized for TTS tasks, thereby reducing the dependency on diacritic-based text processing. This advancement not only simplifies the language modeling process but also improves the robustness and shows controllability of the speech output due to disentenglement properties of the semantic units. The inclusion of a speaker embedding in the vocoder further aids in capturing the unique vocal characteristics of the speaker, contributing to the naturalness of the synthesized speech. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only maintains high performance in Hebrew but also shows adaptability to English, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing stability in TTS systems universally. Our method, named LOTHM (Language of The Hebrew Man), outperforms existing methods in terms of stability while achieving naturalness and speaker similarity on par with previous methods, making it a compelling choice for future speech synthesis applications.
