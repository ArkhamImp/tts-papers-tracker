- **Abstract**: We introduce a text-to-speech(TTS) framework based on a neural transducer. We use discretized semantic tokens acquired from wav2vec2.0 embeddings, which makes it easy to adopt a neural transducer for the TTS framework enjoying its monotonic alignment constraints. The proposed model first generates aligned semantic tokens using the neural transducer, then synthesizes a speech sample from the semantic tokens using a non-autoregressive(NAR) speech generator. This decoupled framework alleviates the training complexity of TTS and allows each stage to focus on 1) linguistic and alignment modeling and 2) fine-grained acoustic modeling, respectively. Experimental results on the zero-shot adaptive TTS show that the proposed model exceeds the baselines in speech quality and speaker similarity via objective and subjective measures. We also investigate the inference speed and prosody controllability of our proposed model, showing the potential of the neural transducer for TTS frameworks.
