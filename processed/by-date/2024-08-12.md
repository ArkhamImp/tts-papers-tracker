- **Abstract**: This paper presents SaSLaW, a spontaneous dialogue speech corpus containing synchronous recordings of what speakers speak, listen to, and watch. Humans consider the diverse environmental factors and then control the features of their utterances in face-to-face voice communications. Spoken dialogue systems capable of this adaptation to these audio environments enable natural and seamless communications. SaSLaW was developed to model human-speech adjustment for audio environments via first-person audio-visual perceptions in spontaneous dialogues. We propose the construction methodology of SaSLaW and display the analysis result of the corpus. We additionally conducted an experiment to develop text-to-speech models using SaSLaW and evaluate their performance of adaptations to audio environments. The results indicate that models incorporating hearing-audio data output more plausible speech tailored to diverse audio environments than the vanilla text-to-speech model.
