## LLMCARE: Alzheimer's Detection via Transformer Models Enhanced by LLM-Generated Synthetic Data
- **Authors**: Ali Zolnour et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2508.10027](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10027)
- **Tags**: llm-based
- **Abstract**: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

## Improved Dysarthric Speech to Text Conversion via TTS Personalization
- **Authors**: Péter Mihajlik et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2508.06391](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06391)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent progress in generative AI has made it increasingly easy to create natural-sounding deepfake speech from just a few seconds of audio. While these tools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making it possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current research has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has been given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper introduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing, covering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate DSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on different languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and evaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer the first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech generation models when training and inference languages differ. The dataset, protocol and code are available at https://github.com/xuanxixi/Multilingual-Source-Tracing.

## Large Language Model Data Generation for Enhanced Intent Recognition in German Speech
- **Authors**: Theresa Pekarek Rosin et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2508.06277](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06277)
- **Tags**: multilingual, llm-based
- **Abstract**: As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46 languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity, and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing more robust models for evolving generation techniques.

## Llasa+: Free Lunch for Accelerated and Streaming Llama-Based Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Wenjie Tian et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2508.06262](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06262)
- **Tags**: streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper presents the development of a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for the Manipuri language using the Meitei Mayek script. Leveraging Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN, we introduce a neural TTS architecture adapted to support tonal phonology and under-resourced linguistic environments. We develop a phoneme mapping for Meitei Mayek to ARPAbet, curate a single-speaker dataset, and demonstrate intelligible and natural speech synthesis, validated through subjective and objective metrics. This system lays the groundwork for linguistic preservation and technological inclusion of Manipuri.
