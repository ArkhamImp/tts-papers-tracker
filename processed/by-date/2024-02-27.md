- **Abstract**: Text-based voice editing (TBVE) uses synthetic output from text-to-speech (TTS) systems to replace words in an original recording. Recent work has used neural models to produce edited speech that is similar to the original speech in terms of clarity, speaker identity, and prosody. However, one limitation of prior work is the usage of finetuning to optimise performance: this requires further model training on data from the target speaker, which is a costly process that may incorporate potentially sensitive data into server-side models. In contrast, this work focuses on the zero-shot approach which avoids finetuning altogether, and instead uses pretrained speaker verification embeddings together with a jointly trained reference encoder to encode utterance-level information that helps capture aspects such as speaker identity and prosody. Subjective listening tests find that both utterance embeddings and a reference encoder improve the continuity of speaker identity and prosody between the edited synthetic speech and unedited original recording in the zero-shot setting.
