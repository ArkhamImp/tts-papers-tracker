- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems, gradually becoming the mainstream approach. However, most current approaches address these tasks separately rather than through a unified framework. This work aims to integrate these two tasks into one unified model. Although discrete speech tokenization enables joint modeling, its inherent information loss limits performance in both recognition and generation. In this work, we present UniVoice, a unified LLM framework through continuous representations that seamlessly integrates speech recognition and synthesis within a single model. Our approach combines the strengths of autoregressive modeling for speech recognition with flow matching for high-quality generation. To mitigate the inherent divergence between autoregressive and flow-matching models, we further design a dual attention mechanism, which switches between a causal mask for recognition and a bidirectional attention mask for synthesis. Furthermore, the proposed text-prefix-conditioned speech infilling method enables high-fidelity zero-shot voice cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve or exceed current single-task modeling methods in both ASR and zero-shot TTS tasks. This work explores new possibilities for end-to-end speech understanding and generation. Code is available at https://github.com/gwh22/UniVoice.

## Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs

- **Tags**: llm-based
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have enabled systems to generate speech that is often indistinguishable from human speech, bringing benefits to accessibility, content creation, and human-computer interaction. However, current evaluation practices are increasingly inadequate for capturing the full range of capabilities, limitations, and societal impacts of modern TTS systems. This position paper introduces the concept of Responsible Evaluation and argues that it is essential and urgent for the next phase of TTS development, structured through three progressive levels: (1) ensuring the faithful and accurate reflection of a model's true capabilities and limitations, with more robust, discriminative, and comprehensive objective and subjective scoring methodologies; (2) enabling comparability, standardization, and transferability through standardized benchmarks, transparent reporting, and transferable evaluation metrics; and (3) assessing and mitigating ethical risks associated with forgery, misuse, privacy violations, and security vulnerabilities. Through this concept, we critically examine current evaluation practices, identify systemic shortcomings, and propose actionable recommendations. We hope this concept will not only foster more reliable and trustworthy TTS technology but also guide its development toward ethically sound and societally beneficial applications.

## Mismatch Aware Guidance for Robust Emotion Control in Auto-Regressive TTS Models
- **Authors**: Yizhou Peng et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2510.13293](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13293)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore, we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset, UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at https://cmots.github.io/uniss-demo.

## DiSTAR: Diffusion over a Scalable Token Autoregressive Representation for Speech Generation

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, particularly those leveraging large language models (LLMs), have significantly improved expressiveness and naturalness. However, generating human-like, interactive dialogue speech remains challenging. Current systems face limitations due to the scarcity of dual-track data and difficulties in achieving naturalness, contextual coherence, and interactional dynamics, such as turn-taking, overlapping speech, and speaker consistency, in multi-turn conversations. To address these challenges, we propose DialoSpeech, a dual-track architecture combining a large language model with Chunked Flow Matching for expressive, human-like dialogue speech synthesis. DialoSpeech generates natural multi-turn conversations with coherent speaker turns and natural overlaps, supporting both Chinese and English and cross-lingual speech synthesis. We introduce a data processing pipeline to construct dual-track dialogue datasets, facilitating scalable training and experimental validation. Experiments show that our model outperforms baselines, offering a solution for generating human-like spoken dialogues. Audio samples are available at https://tiamojames.github.io/DialoSpeech
