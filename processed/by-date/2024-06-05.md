- **Abstract**: Historically, most speech models in machine-learning have used the mel-spectrogram as a speech representation. Recently, discrete audio tokens produced by neural audio codecs have become a popular alternate speech representation for speech synthesis tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS). However, the data distribution produced by such codecs is too complex for some TTS models to predict, typically requiring large autoregressive models to get good quality. Most existing audio codecs use Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to compress and reconstruct the time-domain audio signal. We propose a spectral codec which uses Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) to compress the mel-spectrogram and reconstruct the time-domain audio signal. A study of objective audio quality metrics and subjective listening tests suggests that our spectral codec has comparable perceptual quality to equivalent audio codecs. We show that FSQ, and the use of spectral speech representations, can both improve the performance of parallel TTS models.

## LiveSpeech: Low-Latency Zero-shot Text-to-Speech via Autoregressive Modeling of Audio Discrete Codes

- **arXiv**: [2406.02897](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02897)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: In recent years, prompting has quickly become one of the standard ways of steering the outputs of generative machine learning models, due to its intuitive use of natural language. In this work, we propose a system conditioned on embeddings derived from an emotionally rich text that serves as prompt. Thereby, a joint representation of speaker and prompt embeddings is integrated at several points within a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is trained on merged emotional speech and text datasets and varies prompts in each training iteration to increase the generalization capabilities of the model. Objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate the ability of the conditioned synthesis system to accurately transfer the emotions present in a prompt to speech. At the same time, precise tractability of speaker identities as well as overall high speech quality and intelligibility are maintained.

## SimpleSpeech: Towards Simple and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Scalar Latent Transformer Diffusion Models
- **Authors**: Dongchao Yang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2406.02328](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02328)
- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recently proposed two-pass direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models decompose the task into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech (TTS) within an end-to-end model, yielding promising results. However, the training of these models still relies on parallel speech data, which is extremely challenging to collect. In contrast, S2TT and TTS have accumulated a large amount of data and pretrained models, which have not been fully utilized in the development of S2ST models. Inspired by this, in this paper, we first introduce a composite S2ST model named ComSpeech, which can seamlessly integrate any pretrained S2TT and TTS models into a direct S2ST model. Furthermore, to eliminate the reliance on parallel speech data, we propose a novel training method ComSpeech-ZS that solely utilizes S2TT and TTS data. It aligns representations in the latent space through contrastive learning, enabling the speech synthesis capability learned from the TTS data to generalize to S2ST in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results on the CVSS dataset show that when the parallel speech data is available, ComSpeech surpasses previous two-pass models like UnitY and Translatotron 2 in both translation quality and decoding speed. When there is no parallel speech data, ComSpeech-ZS lags behind \name by only 0.7 ASR-BLEU and outperforms the cascaded models.
