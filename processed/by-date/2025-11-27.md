- **Abstract**: Discrete speech tokens have gained attention for their storage efficiency and integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). They are commonly categorized into acoustic and semantic tokens, with the latter being more advantageous for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Traditionally, unsupervised K-means clustering has been used to extract semantic speech tokens from Speech Foundation Models (SFMs). Recently, supervised methods, such as finite scalar quantization (FSQ) trained with ASR loss, have emerged for speech generation. Both approaches leverage pre-trained SFMs, benefiting low-resource tasks such as child ASR. This paper systematically compares supervised and unsupervised semantic speech tokens for child ASR. Results show that supervised methods not only outperform unsupervised ones but even unexpectedly surpass continuous representations, and they perform well even in ultra-low bitrate settings. These findings highlight the advantages of supervised semantic tokens and offer insights for improving discrete speech tokenization.

- **Abstract**: The task of Visual Text-to-Speech (VisualTTS), also known as video dubbing, aims to generate speech synchronized with the lip movements in an input video, in additional to being consistent with the content of input text and cloning the timbre of a reference speech. Existing VisualTTS models typically adopt lightweight architectures and design specialized modules to achieve the above goals respectively, yet the speech quality is not satisfied due to the model capacity and the limited data in VisualTTS. Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics.

## Joint Speech and Text Training for LLM-Based End-to-End Spoken Dialogue State Tracking

- **Tags**: llm-based
- **Abstract**: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

- **Abstract**: The development of robust transliteration techniques to enhance the effectiveness of transforming Romanized scripts into native scripts is crucial for Natural Language Processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, speech recognition, information retrieval, and intelligent personal assistants. Despite significant advancements, state-of-the-art multilingual models still face challenges in handling Romanized script, where the Roman alphabet is adopted to represent the phonetic structure of diverse languages. Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel transliteration dataset for two popular Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi and Bengali, which are ranked as the 3rd and 7th most spoken languages worldwide. Our dataset comprises nearly 1.8 million Hindi and 1 million Bengali transliteration pairs. In addition to that, we pre-train a custom multilingual seq2seq LLM based on Marian architecture using the developed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing relevant models in terms of BLEU and CER metrics.

## VSpeechLM: A Visual Speech Language Model for Visual Text-to-Speech Task

- **Abstract**: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

- **Abstract**: Automated detection and classification of marine mammals vocalizations is critical for conservation and management efforts but is hindered by limited annotated datasets and the acoustic complexity of real-world marine environments. Data augmentation has proven to be an effective strategy to address this limitation by increasing dataset diversity and improving model generalization without requiring additional field data. However, most augmentation techniques used to date rely on effective but relatively simple transformations, leaving open the question of whether deep generative models can provide additional benefits. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep generative for data augmentation in marine mammal call detection including: Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Using Southern Resident Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from two long-term hydrophone deployments in the Salish Sea, we compare these approaches against traditional augmentation methods such as time-shifting and vocalization masking. While all generative approaches improved classification performance relative to the baseline, diffusion-based augmentation yielded the highest recall (0.87) and overall F1-score (0.75). A hybrid strategy combining generative-based synthesis with traditional methods achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.81. We hope this study encourages further exploration of deep generative models as complementary augmentation strategies to advance acoustic monitoring of threatened marine mammal populations.
