- **Abstract**: Spoken dialogue systems powered by large language models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding human speech and generating appropriate spoken responses. However, these systems struggle with end-turn detection (ETD) -- the ability to distinguish between user turn completion and hesitation. This limitation often leads to premature or delayed responses, disrupting the flow of spoken conversations. In this paper, we introduce the ETD Dataset, the first public dataset for end-turn detection. The ETD dataset consists of both synthetic speech data generated with text-to-speech models and real-world speech data collected from web sources. We also propose SpeculativeETD, a novel collaborative inference framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to improve real-time ETD in resource-constrained environments. Our approach jointly employs a lightweight GRU-based model, which rapidly detects the non-speaking units in real-time on local devices, and a high-performance Wav2vec-based model running on the server to make a more challenging classification of distinguishing turn ends from mere pauses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpeculativeETD significantly improves ETD accuracy while keeping the required computations low. Datasets and code will be available after the review.

## Text-Driven Voice Conversion via Latent State-Space Modeling

- **Abstract**: This paper presents a dual-stream text-to-speech (TTS) model, SyncSpeech, capable of receiving streaming text input from upstream models while simultaneously generating streaming speech, facilitating seamless interaction with large language models. SyncSpeech has the following advantages: Low latency, as it begins generating streaming speech upon receiving the second text token; High efficiency, as it decodes all speech tokens corresponding to the each arrived text token in one step. To achieve this, we propose a temporal masked transformer as the backbone of SyncSpeech, combined with token-level duration prediction to predict speech tokens and the duration for the next step. Additionally, we design a two-stage training strategy to improve training efficiency and the quality of generated speech. We evaluated the SyncSpeech on both English and Mandarin datasets. Compared to the recent dual-stream TTS models, SyncSpeech significantly reduces the first packet delay of speech tokens and accelerates the real-time factor. Moreover, with the same data scale, SyncSpeech achieves performance comparable to that of traditional autoregressive-based TTS models in terms of both speech quality and robustness.

## Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report
- **Authors**: Jin Xu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2503.20215](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20215)
- **Tags**: other
- **Abstract**: This document is provided as a guideline for reviewers of papers about speech synthesis. We outline some best practices and common pitfalls for papers about speech synthesis, with a particular focus on evaluation. We also recommend that reviewers check the guidelines for authors written in the paper kit and consider those as reviewing criteria as well. This is intended to be a living document, and it will be updated as we receive comments and feedback from readers. We note that this document is meant to provide guidance only, and that reviewers should ultimately use their own discretion when evaluating papers.

## InnerSelf: Designing Self-Deepfaked Voice for Emotional Well-being
- **Authors**: Guang Dai et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2503.14257](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14257)
- **Tags**: expressive
- **Abstract**: Singing voice synthesis has made remarkable progress in generating natural and high-quality voices. However, existing methods rarely provide precise control over vocal techniques such as intensity, mixed voice, falsetto, bubble, and breathy tones, thus limiting the expressive potential of synthetic voices. We introduce TechSinger, an advanced system for controllable singing voice synthesis that supports five languages and seven vocal techniques. TechSinger leverages a flow-matching-based generative model to produce singing voices with enhanced expressive control over various techniques. To enhance the diversity of training data, we develop a technique detection model that automatically annotates datasets with phoneme-level technique labels. Additionally, our prompt-based technique prediction model enables users to specify desired vocal attributes through natural language, offering fine-grained control over the synthesized singing. Experimental results demonstrate that TechSinger significantly enhances the expressiveness and realism of synthetic singing voices, outperforming existing methods in terms of audio quality and technique-specific control.
