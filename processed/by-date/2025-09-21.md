## Sidon: Fast and Robust Open-Source Multilingual Speech Restoration for Large-scale Dataset Cleansing
- **Authors**: Wataru Nakata et.al.

- **Tags**: streaming, multilingual
- **Abstract**: We present VoXtream, a fully autoregressive, zero-shot streaming text-to-speech (TTS) system for real-time use that begins speaking from the first word. VoXtream directly maps incoming phonemes to audio tokens using a monotonic alignment scheme and a limited look-ahead that does not delay onset. Built around an incremental phoneme transformer, a temporal transformer predicting semantic and duration tokens, and a depth transformer producing acoustic tokens, VoXtream achieves, to our knowledge, the lowest initial delay among publicly available streaming TTS: 102 ms on GPU. Despite being trained on a mid-scale 9k-hour corpus, it matches or surpasses larger baselines on several metrics, while delivering competitive quality in both output- and full-streaming settings. Demo and code are available at https://herimor.github.io/voxtream.

## Bridging the gap between training and inference in LM-based TTS models

- **Abstract**: In zero-shot text-to-speech, achieving a balance between fidelity to the target speaker and adherence to text content remains a challenge. While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.

## MBCodec:Thorough disentangle for high-fidelity audio compression

- **Abstract**: Voice cloning for Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to generate expressive and personalized speech from text using limited data from a target speaker. Federated Learning (FL) offers a collaborative and privacy-preserving framework for this task, but existing approaches suffer from high communication costs and tend to suppress stylistic heterogeneity, resulting in insufficient personalization. To address these issues, we propose Fed-PISA, which stands for Federated Personalized Identity-Style Adaptation. To minimize communication costs, Fed-PISA introduces a disentangled Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanism: the speaker's timbre is retained locally through a private ID-LoRA, while only a lightweight style-LoRA is transmitted to the server, thereby minimizing parameter exchange. To harness heterogeneity, our aggregation method, inspired by collaborative filtering, is introduced to create custom models for each client by learning from stylistically similar peers. Experiments show that Fed-PISA improves style expressivity, naturalness, and speaker similarity, outperforming standard federated baselines with minimal communication costs.
