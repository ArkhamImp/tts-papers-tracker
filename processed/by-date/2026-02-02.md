## WAXAL: A Large-Scale Multilingual African Language Speech Corpus

- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.

## LipSody: Lip-to-Speech Synthesis with Enhanced Prosody Consistency
- **Authors**: Jaejun Lee et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2602.01908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01908)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Lip-to-speech synthesis aims to generate speech audio directly from silent facial video by reconstructing linguistic content from lip movements, providing valuable applications in situations where audio signals are unavailable or degraded. While recent diffusion-based models such as LipVoicer have demonstrated impressive performance in reconstructing linguistic content, they often lack prosodic consistency. In this work, we propose LipSody, a lip-to-speech framework enhanced for prosody consistency. LipSody introduces a prosody-guiding strategy that leverages three complementary cues: speaker identity extracted from facial images, linguistic content derived from lip movements, and emotional context inferred from face video. Experimental results demonstrate that LipSody substantially improves prosody-related metrics, including global and local pitch deviations, energy consistency, and speaker similarity, compared to prior approaches.
