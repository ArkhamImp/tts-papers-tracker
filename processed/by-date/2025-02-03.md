- **Abstract**: We introduce Metis, a foundation model for unified speech generation. Unlike previous task-specific or multi-task models, Metis follows a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. It is pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled speech data using masked generative modeling and then fine-tuned to adapt to diverse speech generation tasks. Specifically, 1) Metis utilizes two discrete speech representations: SSL tokens derived from speech self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and acoustic tokens directly quantized from waveforms. 2) Metis performs masked generative pre-training on SSL tokens, utilizing 300K hours of diverse speech data, without any additional condition. 3) Through fine-tuning with task-specific conditions, Metis achieves efficient adaptation to various speech generation tasks while supporting multimodal input, even when using limited data and trainable parameters. Experiments demonstrate that Metis can serve as a foundation model for unified speech generation: Metis outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five speech generation tasks, including zero-shot text-to-speech, voice conversion, target speaker extraction, speech enhancement, and lip-to-speech, even with fewer than 20M trainable parameters or 300 times less training data.
