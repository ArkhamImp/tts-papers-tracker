- **Abstract**: While persona-driven large language models (LLMs) and prompt-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems have advanced significantly, a usability gap arises when users attempt to generate voices matching their desired personas from implicit descriptions. Most users lack specialized knowledge to specify detailed voice attributes, which often leads TTS systems to misinterpret their expectations. To address these gaps, we introduce Persona-to-Voice-Attribute (P2VA), the first framework enabling voice generation automatically from persona descriptions. Our approach employs two strategies: P2VA-C for structured voice attributes, and P2VA-O for richer style descriptions. Evaluation shows our P2VA-C reduces WER by 5% and improves MOS by 0.33 points. To the best of our knowledge, P2VA is the first framework to establish a connection between persona and voice synthesis. In addition, we discover that current LLMs embed societal biases in voice attributes during the conversion process. Our experiments and findings further provide insights into the challenges of building persona-voice systems.

- **Abstract**: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat. In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.

- **Abstract**: In our prior works, we introduced a scalable streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which integrates a large language model (LLM) and a chunk-aware flow matching (FM) model, and achieves low-latency bi-streaming speech synthesis and human-parity quality. Despite these advancements, CosyVoice 2 exhibits limitations in language coverage, domain diversity, data volume, text formats, and post-training techniques. In this paper, we present CosyVoice 3, an improved model designed for zero-shot multilingual speech synthesis in the wild, surpassing its predecessor in content consistency, speaker similarity, and prosody naturalness. Key features of CosyVoice 3 include: 1) A novel speech tokenizer to improve prosody naturalness, developed via supervised multi-task training, including automatic speech recognition, speech emotion recognition, language identification, audio event detection, and speaker analysis. 2) A new differentiable reward model for post-training applicable not only to CosyVoice 3 but also to other LLM-based speech synthesis models. 3) Dataset Size Scaling: Training data is expanded from ten thousand hours to one million hours, encompassing 9 languages and 18 Chinese dialects across various domains and text formats. 4) Model Size Scaling: Model parameters are increased from 0.5 billion to 1.5 billion, resulting in enhanced performance on our multilingual benchmark due to the larger model capacity. These advancements contribute significantly to the progress of speech synthesis in the wild. We encourage readers to listen to the demo at https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice3.

## Pairwise Evaluation of Accent Similarity in Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Binaural rendering aims to synthesize binaural audio that mimics natural hearing based on a mono audio and the locations of the speaker and listener. Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds. Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable from real-world recordings, with a $42\%$ confusion rate.

- **Abstract**: We analyze the syntactic sensitivity of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems using methods inspired by psycholinguistic research. Specifically, we focus on the generation of intonational phrase boundaries, which can often be predicted by identifying syntactic boundaries within a sentence. We find that TTS systems struggle to accurately generate intonational phrase boundaries in sentences where syntactic boundaries are ambiguous (e.g., garden path sentences or sentences with attachment ambiguity). In these cases, systems need superficial cues such as commas to place boundaries at the correct positions. In contrast, for sentences with simpler syntactic structures, we find that systems do incorporate syntactic cues beyond surface markers. Finally, we finetune models on sentences without commas at the syntactic boundary positions, encouraging them to focus on more subtle linguistic cues. Our findings indicate that this leads to more distinct intonation patterns that better reflect the underlying structure.

- **Abstract**: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-speech (TTS) voice cloning have raised serious privacy concerns, allowing highly accurate vocal identity replication from just a few seconds of reference audio, while retaining the speaker's vocal authenticity. In this paper, we introduce CloneShield, a universal time-domain adversarial perturbation framework specifically designed to defend against zero-shot voice cloning. Our method provides protection that is robust across speakers and utterances, without requiring any prior knowledge of the synthesized text. We formulate perturbation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to ensure the robust protection across diverse utterances. To preserve natural auditory perception for users, we decompose the adversarial perturbation via Mel-spectrogram representations and fine-tune it for each sample. This design ensures imperceptibility while maintaining strong degradation effects on zero-shot cloned outputs. Experiments on three state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems, five benchmark datasets and evaluations from 60 human listeners demonstrate that our method preserves near-original audio quality in protected inputs (PESQ = 3.90, SRS = 0.93) while substantially degrading both speaker similarity and speech quality in cloned samples (PESQ = 1.07, SRS = 0.08).
