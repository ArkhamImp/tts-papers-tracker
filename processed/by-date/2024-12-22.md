## Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective
- **Authors**: Hankun Wang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2412.17048](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17048)
- **Tags**: multilingual, llm-based
- **Abstract**: This paper presents a new voice conversion model capable of transforming both speaking and singing voices. It addresses key challenges in current systems, such as conveying emotions, managing pronunciation and accent changes, and reproducing non-verbal sounds. One of the model's standout features is its ability to perform accent conversion on hybrid voice samples that encompass both speech and singing, allowing it to change the speaker's accent while preserving the original content and prosody. The proposed model uses an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder is based on HuBERT to process the speech's acoustic and linguistic content, while the HiFi-GAN decoder audio matches the target speaker's voice. The model incorporates fundamental frequency (f0) features and singer embeddings to enhance performance while ensuring the pitch &amp; tone accuracy and vocal identity are preserved during transformation. This approach improves how naturally and flexibly voice style can be transformed, showing strong potential for applications in voice dubbing, content creation, and technologies like Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems.

## Incremental Disentanglement for Environment-Aware Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Ye-Xin Lu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2412.16977](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16977)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces Interleaved Speech-Text Language Model (IST-LM) for zero-shot streaming Text-to-Speech (TTS). Unlike many previous approaches, IST-LM is directly trained on interleaved sequences of text and speech tokens with a fixed ratio, eliminating the need for additional efforts like forced alignment or complex designs. The ratio of text chunk size to speech chunk size is crucial for the performance of IST-LM. To explore this, we conducted a comprehensive series of statistical analyses on the training data and performed correlation analysis with the final performance, uncovering several key factors: 1) the distance between speech tokens and their corresponding text tokens, 2) the number of future text tokens accessible to each speech token, and 3) the frequency of speech tokens precedes their corresponding text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate how to achieve an optimal streaming TTS system with a limited performance gap compared to its non-streaming counterpart. IST-LM is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, enabling streaming TTS with minimal overhead while largely preserving performance, and offering broad potential for integration with real-time text streams from large language models.

## Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Next-Distribution Prediction
- **Authors**: Xinfa Zhu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2412.16846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16846)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: Humans can perceive speakers' characteristics (e.g., identity, gender, personality and emotion) by their appearance, which are generally aligned to their voice style. Recently, vision-driven Text-to-speech (TTS) scholars grounded their investigations on real-person faces, thereby restricting effective speech synthesis from applying to vast potential usage scenarios with diverse characters and image styles. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel FaceSpeak approach. It extracts salient identity characteristics and emotional representations from a wide variety of image styles. Meanwhile, it mitigates the extraneous information (e.g., background, clothing, and hair color, etc.), resulting in synthesized speech closely aligned with a character's persona. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of multi-modal TTS data, we have devised an innovative dataset, namely Expressive Multi-Modal TTS, which is diligently curated and annotated to facilitate research in this domain. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed FaceSpeak can generate portrait-aligned voice with satisfactory naturalness and quality.
