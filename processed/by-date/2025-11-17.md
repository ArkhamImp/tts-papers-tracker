- **Abstract**: Text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-music (TTM) models face significant limitations in instruction-based control. TTS systems usually depend on reference audio for timbre, offer only limited text-level attribute control, and rarely support dialogue generation. TTM systems are constrained by input conditioning requirements that depend on expert knowledge annotations. The high heterogeneity of these input control conditions makes them difficult to joint modeling with speech synthesis. Despite sharing common acoustic modeling characteristics, these two tasks have long been developed independently, leaving open the challenge of achieving unified modeling through natural language instructions. We introduce InstructAudio, a unified framework that enables instruction-based (natural language descriptions) control of acoustic attributes including timbre (gender, age), paralinguistic (emotion, style, accent), and musical (genre, instrument, rhythm, atmosphere). It supports expressive speech, music, and dialogue generation in English and Chinese. The model employs joint and single diffusion transformer layers with a standardized instruction-phoneme input format, trained on 50K hours of speech and 20K hours of music data, enabling multi-task learning and cross-modal alignment. Fig. 1 visualizes performance comparisons with mainstream TTS and TTM models, demonstrating that InstructAudio achieves optimal results on most metrics. To our best knowledge, InstructAudio represents the first instruction-controlled framework unifying speech and music generation.

- **Abstract**: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

- **Abstract**: This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.

- **Abstract**: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.

- **Abstract**: This paper addresses data quality issues in multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) through systematic quality control and multi-stage transfer learning. We implement a quality control pipeline for MELD and IEMOCAP datasets that validates speaker identity, audio-text alignment, and face detection. We leverage transfer learning from speaker and face recognition, assuming that identity-discriminative embeddings capture not only stable acoustic and Facial traits but also person-specific patterns of emotional expression. We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.

- **Abstract**: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.

- **Abstract**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.

- **Abstract**: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components are trained jointly, is an attractive alternative to cascaded systems because it offers a simpler pipeline and lower inference latency. However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English
