- **Abstract**: We present a virtual reality (VR) environment featuring conversational avatars powered by a locally-deployed LLM, integrated with automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and lip-syncing. Through a pilot study, we explored the effects of three types of avatar status indicators during response generation. Our findings reveal design considerations for improving responsiveness and realism in LLM-driven conversational systems. We also detail two system architectures: one using an LLM-based state machine to control avatar behavior and another integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-grounded responses. Together, these contributions offer practical insights to guide future work in developing task-oriented conversational AI in VR environments.

## Rethinking MUSHRA: Addressing Modern Challenges in Text-to-Speech Evaluation

- **Abstract**: Continual learning for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems poses a challenge, especially with the need to avoid catastrophic forgetting while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging the machine speech chain framework to enable continual learning in ASR using gradient episodic memory (GEM). By incorporating a text-to-speech (TTS) component within the machine speech chain, we support the replay mechanism essential for GEM, allowing the ASR model to learn new tasks sequentially without significant performance degradation on earlier tasks. Our experiments, conducted on the LJ Speech dataset, demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional fine-tuning and multitask learning approaches, achieving a substantial error rate reduction while maintaining high performance across varying noise conditions. We showed the potential of our semi-supervised machine speech chain approach for effective and efficient continual learning in speech recognition.

## Leveraging Virtual Reality and AI Tutoring for Language Learning: A Case Study of a Virtual Campus Environment with OpenAI GPT Integration with Unity 3D

- **Abstract**: AI-generated media products are increasingly prevalent in the news industry, yet their impacts on audience perception remain underexplored. Traditional media often employs negative framing to capture attention and capitalize on news consumption, and without oversight, AI-generated news could reinforce this trend. This study examines how different framing styles-constructive versus non-constructive-affect audience responses in AI-generated podcasts. We developed a pipeline using generative AI and text-to-speech (TTS) technology to create both constructive and non-constructive news podcasts from the same set of news resources. Through empirical research (N=65), we found that constructive podcasts significantly reduced audience's negative emotions compared to non-constructive podcasts. Additionally, in certain news contexts, constructive framing might further enhance audience self-efficacy. Our findings show that simply altering the framing of AI generated content can significantly impact audience responses, and we offer insights on leveraging these effects for positive outcomes while minimizing ethical risks.
