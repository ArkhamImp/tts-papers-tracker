## EmoMix: Emotion Mixing via Diffusion Models for Emotional Speech Synthesis

- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recently, end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have made great strides and exhibit excellent performance in general speech recognition. However, there remain several challenging scenarios that E2E models are not competent in, such as code-switching and named entity recognition (NER). Data augmentation is a common and effective practice for these two scenarios. However, the current data augmentation methods mainly rely on audio splicing and text-to-speech (TTS) models, which might result in discontinuous, unrealistic, and less diversified speech. To mitigate these potential issues, we propose a novel data augmentation method by applying the text-based speech editing model. The augmented speech from speech editing systems is more coherent and diversified, also more akin to real speech. The experimental results on code-switching and NER tasks show that our proposed method can significantly outperform the audio splicing and neural TTS based data augmentation systems.

## The Effects of Input Type and Pronunciation Dictionary Usage in Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Text-to-Speech

- **Abstract**: There has been significant progress in emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis technology in recent years. However, existing methods primarily focus on the synthesis of a limited number of emotion types and have achieved unsatisfactory performance in intensity control. To address these limitations, we propose EmoMix, which can generate emotional speech with specified intensity or a mixture of emotions. Specifically, EmoMix is a controllable emotional TTS model based on a diffusion probabilistic model and a pre-trained speech emotion recognition (SER) model used to extract emotion embedding. Mixed emotion synthesis is achieved by combining the noises predicted by diffusion model conditioned on different emotions during only one sampling process at the run-time. We further apply the Neutral and specific primary emotion mixed in varying degrees to control intensity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of EmoMix for synthesizing mixed emotion and intensity control.

## PromptStyle: Controllable Style Transfer for Text-to-Speech with Natural Language Descriptions

- **arXiv**: [2305.19522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19522)
- **Tags**: expressive, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Many neural text-to-speech architectures can synthesize nearly natural speech from text inputs. These architectures must be trained with tens of hours of annotated and high-quality speech data. Compiling such large databases for every new voice requires a lot of time and effort. In this paper, we describe a method to extend the popular Tacotron-2 architecture and its training with data augmentation to enable single-speaker synthesis using a limited amount of specific training data. In contrast to elaborate augmentation methods proposed in the literature, we use simple stationary noises for data augmentation. Our extension is easy to implement and adds almost no computational overhead during training and inference. Using only two hours of training data, our approach was rated by human listeners to be on par with the baseline Tacotron-2 trained with 23.5 hours of LJSpeech data. In addition, we tested our model with a semantically unpredictable sentences test, which showed that both models exhibit similar intelligibility levels.

## SQuId: Measuring Speech Naturalness in Many Languages
- **Authors**: Thibault Sellam et.al.

- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: This paper proposes a method for selecting training data for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis from dark data. TTS models are typically trained on high-quality speech corpora that cost much time and money for data collection, which makes it very challenging to increase speaker variation. In contrast, there is a large amount of data whose availability is unknown (a.k.a, "dark data"), such as YouTube videos. To utilize data other than TTS corpora, previous studies have selected speech data from the corpora on the basis of acoustic quality. However, considering that TTS models robust to data noise have been proposed, we should select data on the basis of its importance as training data to the given TTS model, not the quality of speech itself. Our method with a loop of training and evaluation selects training data on the basis of the automatically predicted quality of synthetic speech of a given TTS model. Results of evaluations using YouTube data reveal that our method outperforms the conventional acoustic-quality-based method.
