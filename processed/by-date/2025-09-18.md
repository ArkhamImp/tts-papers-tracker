- **Abstract**: The task of Mel vocoding, i.e., the inversion of a Mel magnitude spectrogram to an audio waveform, is still a key component in many text-to-speech (TTS) systems today. Based on generative flow matching, our prior work on generative STFT phase retrieval (DiffPhase), and the pseudoinverse operator of the Mel filterbank, we develop MelFlow, a streaming-capable generative Mel vocoder for speech sampled at 16 kHz with an algorithmic latency of only 32 ms and a total latency of 48 ms. We show real-time streaming capability at this latency not only in theory, but in practice on a consumer laptop GPU. Furthermore, we show that our model achieves substantially better PESQ and SI-SDR values compared to well-established not streaming-capable baselines for Mel vocoding including HiFi-GAN.

- **Abstract**: Phonemization, the conversion of text into phonemes, is a key step in text-to-speech. Traditional approaches use rule-based transformations and lexicon lookups, while more advanced methods apply preprocessing techniques or neural networks for improved accuracy on out-of-domain vocabulary. However, all systems struggle with names, loanwords, abbreviations, and homographs. This work presents OLaPh (Optimal Language Phonemizer), a framework that combines large lexica, multiple NLP techniques, and compound resolution with a probabilistic scoring function. Evaluations in German and English show improved accuracy over previous approaches, including on a challenging dataset. To further address unresolved cases, we train a large language model on OLaPh-generated data, which achieves even stronger generalization and performance. Together, the framework and LLM improve phonemization consistency and provide a freely available resource for future research.

## Real-Time Streaming Mel Vocoding with Generative Flow Matching
- **Authors**: Simon Welker et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.15085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15085)
- **Tags**: streaming
- **Abstract**: When being delivered in applications or services on the cloud, static speech deepfake detectors that are not updated will become vulnerable to newly created speech deepfake attacks. From the perspective of machine learning operations (MLOps), this paper tries to answer whether we can monitor new and unseen speech deepfake data that drifts away from a seen reference data set. We further ask, if drift is detected, whether we can fine-tune the detector using similarly drifted data, reduce the drift, and improve the detection performance. On a toy dataset and the large-scale MLAAD dataset, we show that the drift caused by new text-to-speech (TTS) attacks can be monitored using distances between the distributions of the new data and reference data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the detector using data generated by the new TTS deepfakes can reduce the drift and the detection error rates.

## MELA-TTS: Joint transformer-diffusion model with representation alignment for speech synthesis
- **Authors**: Keyu An et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.14784](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14784)
- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces DiFlow-TTS, a novel zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) system that employs discrete flow matching for generative speech modeling. We position this work as an entry point that may facilitate further advances in this research direction. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we analyze both the strengths and limitations of this approach across key aspects, including naturalness, expressive attributes, speaker identity, and inference latency. To this end, we leverage factorized speech representations and design a deterministic Phoneme-Content Mapper for modeling linguistic content, together with a Factorized Discrete Flow Denoiser that jointly models multiple discrete token streams corresponding to prosody and acoustics to capture expressive speech attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves strong performance across multiple metrics while maintaining a compact model size, up to 11.7 times smaller, and enabling low-latency inference that is up to 34 times faster than recent state-of-the-art baselines. Audio samples are available on our demo page: https://diflow-tts.github.io.

## DAIEN-TTS: Disentangled Audio Infilling for Environment-Aware Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Ye-Xin Lu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.14684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14684)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) have shown that language model (LM) based systems offer competitive performance compared to traditional approaches. However, in training, TTS models use ground-truth (GT) tokens as prefixes to predict the next token, while in inference these tokens are not available, a gap between training and inference that is often neglected. In this study, we propose a prompt-guided hybrid training scheme to mitigate exposure bias in popular LM-based TTS systems. Our core idea is to adopt a hybrid training paradigm that combines teacher forcing with free running, thereby introducing self-generated tokens into the training process. This makes the training mode more consistent with inference, reducing the training-inference gap. In addition, we incorporate an EOS prediction mechanism during training to detect incorrect sequence termination and adaptively control the free running process. Experimental results provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of exposure bias on LM-based TTS, and demonstrate that our method effectively narrows the training-inference gap, thereby improving the quality of synthesized long-form speech.

## Stochastic Clock Attention for Aligning Continuous and Ordered Sequences

- **Abstract**: While existing speech audio codecs designed for compression exploit limited forms of temporal redundancy and allow for multi-scale representations, they tend to represent all features of audio in the same way. In contrast, generative voice models designed for text-to-speech and voice transfer tasks have recently proved effective at factorizing audio signals into high-level semantic representations of fundamentally distinct features. In this paper, we leverage such representations in a novel semantic communications approach to achieve lower bitrates without sacrificing perceptual quality or suitability for specific downstream tasks. Our technique matches or outperforms existing audio codecs on transcription, sentiment analysis, and speaker verification when encoding at 2-4x lower bitrate -- notably surpassing Encodec in perceptual quality and speaker verification while using up to 4x less bitrate.

## SpeechMLC: Speech Multi-label Classification
- **Authors**: Miseul Kim et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.14677](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14677)
- **Tags**: other
- **Abstract**: This paper proposes a GRPO-based approach to enhance the performance of large language model (LLM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by deriving rewards from an off-the-shelf automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. Compared to previous reinforcement learning methods for LLM-based TTS, our method requires no dedicated model for reward computation or training. Moreover, we design a composite reward function that combines character error rate (CER) with negative log-likelihood (NLL) obtained from the ASR model, providing more informative and accurate reward signals. We apply GRPO fine-tuning to pre-trained LLM-based TTS models and evaluate their zero-shot TTS performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method substantially improves both the intelligibility and naturalness of synthesized speech. Ablation studies and further analyses confirm the effectiveness of integrating the two reward components.

## Cross-Lingual F5-TTS: Towards Language-Agnostic Voice Cloning and Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Qingyu Liu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.14579](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14579)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces three self-contained data augmentation methods for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Our techniques first generate novel text--using gloss-based replacement, random replacement, or an LLM-based approach--and then apply Text-to-Speech (TTS) to produce synthetic audio. We apply these methods, which leverage only the original annotated data, to four languages with extremely limited resources (Vatlongos, Nashta, Shinekhen Buryat, and Kakabe). Fine-tuning a pretrained Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model on a combination of the original audio and generated synthetic data yields significant performance gains, including a 14.3% absolute WER reduction for Nashta. The methods prove effective across all four low-resource languages and also show utility for high-resource languages like English, demonstrating their broad applicability.

## Do You Hear What I Mean? Quantifying the Instruction-Perception Gap in Instruction-Guided Expressive Text-To-Speech Systems
- **Authors**: Yi-Cheng Lin et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.13989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13989)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Existing text-to-speech systems predominantly focus on single-sentence synthesis and lack adequate contextual modeling as well as fine-grained performance control capabilities for generating coherent multicast audiobooks. To address these limitations, we propose a context-aware and emotion controllable speech synthesis framework specifically engineered for multicast audiobooks with three key innovations: a context mechanism for contextual consistency, a disentanglement paradigm to decouple style control from speech prompts for semantic consistency, and self-distillation to boost emotional expressiveness and instruction controllability. Experimental results show superior performance across the generation of narration, dialogue, and the whole chapter, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Demo samples can be found in https://everest-ai.github.io/.
