- **Abstract**: With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse applications, there is a pressing need for task-centered, high-quality training data. A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseAnnotate, we conducted case studies involving over 1,000 annotators across two domains: culturally diverse images and 3D scenes. We curate a human-annotated multi-modal dataset of 3,531 images, 898 3D scenes, and 7,460 3D objects, with audio-aligned dense annotations in 20 languages, including 8,746 image captions, 2,000 scene captions, and 19,000 object captions. Models trained on this dataset exhibit improvements of 5% in multilingual, 47% in cultural alignment, and 54% in 3D spatial capabilities. Our results show that our platform offers a feasible approach for future vision-language research and can be applied to various tasks and diverse types of data.

## Language-Aided State Estimation

- **Abstract**: Facilitated by the speech generation framework that disentangles speech into content, speaker, and prosody, voice anonymization is accomplished by substituting the original speaker embedding vector with that of a pseudo-speaker. In this framework, the pseudo-speaker generation forms a fundamental challenge. Current pseudo-speaker generation methods demonstrate limitations in the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, consequently restricting their effectiveness in voice privacy protection. Besides, existing model-based methods suffer from heavy computation costs. Especially, in the large-scale scenario where a huge number of pseudo-speakers are generated, the limitations of uniqueness and computational inefficiency become more significant. To this end, this paper proposes a framework for pseudo-speaker generation, which establishes a mapping from speaker identity index to speaker vector in the feedforward architecture, termed IDMap. Specifically, the framework is specified into two models: IDMap-MLP and IDMap-Diff. Experiments were conducted on both small- and large-scale evaluation datasets. Small-scale evaluations on the LibriSpeech dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed IDMap framework in enhancing the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, thereby improving voice privacy protection, while at a reduced computational cost. Large-scale evaluations on the MLS and Common Voice datasets further justified the superiority of the IDMap framework regarding the stability of the voice privacy protection capability as the number of pseudo-speakers increased.

## Analysing Personal Attacks in U.S. Presidential Debates

- **Abstract**: In this work, we address the problem of finegrained traceback of emotional and manipulation characteristics from synthetically manipulated speech. We hypothesize that combining semantic-prosodic cues captured by Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) with fine-grained spectral dynamics from auditory representations can enable more precise tracing of both emotion and manipulation source. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce MiCuNet, a novel multitask framework for fine-grained tracing of emotional and manipulation attributes in synthetically generated speech. Our approach integrates SFM embeddings with spectrogram-based auditory features through a mixed-curvature projection mechanism that spans Hyperbolic, Euclidean, and Spherical spaces guided by a learnable temporal gating mechanism. Our proposed method adopts a multitask learning setup to simultaneously predict original emotions, manipulated emotions, and manipulation sources on the EmoFake dataset (EFD) across both English and Chinese subsets. MiCuNet yields consistent improvements, consistently surpassing conventional fusion strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first study to explore a curvature-adaptive framework specifically tailored for multitask tracking in synthetic speech.

## CLARITY: Contextual Linguistic Adaptation and Accent Retrieval for Dual-Bias Mitigation in Text-to-Speech Generation

- **Abstract**: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the evaluation aspect being measured, the model capabilities required to attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it. We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody, interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

- **Abstract**: Instruction-guided text-to-speech (TTS) research has reached a maturity level where excellent speech generation quality is possible on demand, yet two coupled biases persist: accent bias, where models default to dominant phonetic patterns, and linguistic bias, where dialect-specific lexical and cultural cues are ignored. These biases are interdependent, as authentic accent generation requires both accent fidelity and localized text. We present Contextual Linguistic Adaptation and Retrieval for Inclusive TTS sYnthesis (CLARITY), a backbone-agnostic framework that addresses these biases through dual-signal optimization: (i) contextual linguistic adaptation that localizes input text to the target dialect, and (ii) retrieval-augmented accent prompting (RAAP) that supplies accent-consistent speech prompts. Across twelve English accents, CLARITY improves accent accuracy and fairness while maintaining strong perceptual quality.

- **Abstract**: Brain-to-speech (BTS) systems represent a groundbreaking approach to human communication by enabling the direct transformation of neural activity into linguistic expressions. While recent non-invasive BTS studies have largely focused on decoding predefined words or sentences, achieving open-vocabulary neural communication comparable to natural human interaction requires decoding unconstrained speech. Additionally, effectively integrating diverse signals derived from speech is crucial for developing personalized and adaptive neural communication and rehabilitation solutions for patients. This study investigates the potential of speech synthesis for previously unseen sentences across various speech modes by leveraging phoneme-level information extracted from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals, both independently and in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) signals. Furthermore, we examine the properties affecting phoneme decoding accuracy during sentence reconstruction and offer neurophysiological insights to further enhance EEG decoding for more effective neural communication solutions. Our findings underscore the feasibility of biosignal-based sentence-level speech synthesis for reconstructing unseen sentences, highlighting a significant step toward developing open-vocabulary neural communication systems adapted to diverse patient needs and conditions. Additionally, this study provides meaningful insights into the development of communication and rehabilitation solutions utilizing EEG-based decoding technologies.
