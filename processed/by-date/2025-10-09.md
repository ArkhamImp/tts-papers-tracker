- **Abstract**: We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2% of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original, while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.

## IntMeanFlow: Few-step Speech Generation with Integral Velocity Distillation

- **Abstract**: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%, automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.
