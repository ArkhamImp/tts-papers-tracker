- **Abstract**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have advanced significantly, aiming to accurately replicate human speech's diversity, including unique speaker identities and linguistic nuances. Despite these advancements, achieving an optimal balance between speaker-fidelity and text-intelligibility remains a challenge, particularly when diverse control demands are considered. Addressing this, we introduce DualSpeech, a TTS model that integrates phoneme-level latent diffusion with dual classifier-free guidance. This approach enables exceptional control over speaker-fidelity and text-intelligibility. Experimental results demonstrate that by utilizing the sophisticated control, DualSpeech surpasses existing state-of-the-art TTS models in performance.
