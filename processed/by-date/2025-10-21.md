- **Abstract**: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents. Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER) compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of text normalization phenomena.

## KrishokBondhu: A Retrieval-Augmented Voice-Based Agricultural Advisory Call Center for Bengali Farmers

- **Abstract**: We present a neuromuscular speech interface that translates electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from orofacial muscles during speech articulation directly into audio. We show that self-supervised speech (SS) representations exhibit a strong linear relationship with the electrical power of muscle action potentials: SS features can be linearly mapped to EMG power with a correlation of $r = 0.85$. Moreover, EMG power vectors corresponding to different articulatory gestures form structured and separable clusters in feature space. This relationship: $\text{SS features}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{linear mapping}}$ $\text{EMG power}$ $\xrightarrow{\texttt{gesture-specific clustering}}$ $\text{articulatory movements}$, highlights that SS models implicitly encode articulatory mechanisms. Leveraging this property, we directly map EMG signals to SS feature space and synthesize speech, enabling end-to-end EMG-to-speech generation without explicit articulatory models and vocoder training.

## ParaStyleTTS: Toward Efficient and Robust Paralinguistic Style Control for Expressive Text-to-Speech Generation

- **Abstract**: Prosody is essential for speech technology, shaping comprehension, naturalness, and expressiveness. However, current text-to-speech (TTS) systems still struggle to accurately capture human-like prosodic variation, in part because existing evaluation methods for prosody remain limited. Traditional metrics like Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and offer little insight into why a system sounds unnatural. This study introduces a linguistically informed, semi-automatic framework for evaluating TTS prosody through a two-tier architecture that mirrors human prosodic organization. The method uses quantitative linguistic criteria to evaluate synthesized speech against human speech corpora across multiple acoustic dimensions. By integrating discrete and continuous prosodic measures, it provides objective and interpretable metrics of both event placement and cue realization, while accounting for the natural variability observed across speakers and prosodic cues. Results show strong correlations with perceptual MOS ratings while revealing model-specific weaknesses that traditional perceptual tests alone cannot capture. This approach provides a principled path toward diagnosing, benchmarking, and ultimately improving the prosodic naturalness of next-generation TTS systems.
