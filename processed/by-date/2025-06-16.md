- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses. Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are available at https://de-antifake.github.io.

## From Flat to Feeling: A Feasibility and Impact Study on Dynamic Facial Emotions in AI-Generated Avatars

- **Abstract**: JoyTTS is an end-to-end spoken chatbot that combines large language models (LLM) with text-to-speech (TTS) technology, featuring voice cloning capabilities. This project is built upon the open-source MiniCPM-o and CosyVoice2 models and trained on 2000 hours of conversational data. We have also provided the complete training code to facilitate further development and optimization by the community. On the testing machine seed-tts-zh, it achieves a SS (speaker similarity) score of 0.73 and a WER (Word Error Rate) of 5.09. The code and models, along with training and inference scripts, are available at https://github.com/jdh-algo/JoyTTS.git.

## A Self-Refining Framework for Enhancing ASR Using TTS-Synthesized Data
- **Authors**: Cheng-Kang Chou et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2506.11130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11130)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features, substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models. Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play, including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total) paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.
