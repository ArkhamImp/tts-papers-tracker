- **Abstract**: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans, is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity, real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a "Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate "Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process. Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time interaction.

## Towards Responsible Evaluation for Text-to-Speech

- **Abstract**: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity.

- **Abstract**: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.
