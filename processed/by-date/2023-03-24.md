- **Abstract**: We present a large-scale in-the-wild Japanese laughter corpus and a laughter synthesis method. Previous work on laughter synthesis lacks not only data but also proper ways to represent laughter. To solve these problems, we first propose an in-the-wild corpus comprising $3.5$ hours of laughter, which is to our best knowledge the largest laughter corpus designed for laughter synthesis. We then propose pseudo phonetic tokens (PPTs) to represent laughter by a sequence of discrete tokens, which are obtained by training a clustering model on features extracted from laughter by a pretrained self-supervised model. Laughter can then be synthesized by feeding PPTs into a text-to-speech system. We further show PPTs can be used to train a language model for unconditional laughter generation. Results of comprehensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a baseline method, and can generate natural laughter unconditionally.
