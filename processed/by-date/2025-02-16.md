- **Abstract**: Speech synthesis models convert written text into natural-sounding audio. While earlier models were limited to a single speaker, recent advancements have led to the development of zero-shot systems that generate realistic speech from a wide range of speakers using their voices as additional prompts. However, they still struggle with imitating non-studio-quality samples that differ significantly from the training datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) allows us to successfully use even single recordings of spontaneous speech in noisy environments as prompts. This approach enhances speaker similarity by up to $30pp$ while preserving content and naturalness. It represents a significant step toward creating truly diverse speech corpora, that is crucial in all speech-related tasks.

## SyncSpeech: Low-Latency and Efficient Dual-Stream Text-to-Speech based on Temporal Masked Transformer
- **Authors**: Zhengyan Sheng et.al.

- **Tags**: streaming, llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This study explores voice cloning to generate synthetic speech replicating the unique patterns of individuals with dysarthria. Using the TORGO dataset, we address data scarcity and privacy challenges in speech-language pathology. Our contributions include demonstrating that voice cloning preserves dysarthric speech characteristics, analyzing differences between real and synthetic data, and discussing implications for diagnostics, rehabilitation, and communication. We cloned voices from dysarthric and control speakers using a commercial platform, ensuring gender-matched synthetic voices. A licensed speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluated a subset for dysarthria, speaker gender, and synthetic indicators. The SLP correctly identified dysarthria in all cases and speaker gender in 95% but misclassified 30% of synthetic samples as real, indicating high realism. Our results suggest synthetic speech effectively captures disordered characteristics and that voice cloning has advanced to produce high-quality data resembling real speech, even to trained professionals. This has critical implications for healthcare, where synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity, protect privacy, and enhance AI-driven diagnostics. By enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality speech datasets, voice cloning can improve generalizable models, personalize therapy, and advance assistive technologies for dysarthria. We publicly release our synthetic dataset to foster further research and collaboration, aiming to develop robust models that improve patient outcomes in speech-language pathology.

## Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review

- **Abstract**: Integrating human feedback to align text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human preferences has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the robustness of language model-based TTS systems. Current approaches primarily focus on using preference data annotated at the utterance level. However, frequent issues that affect the listening experience often only arise in specific segments of audio samples, while other segments are well-generated. In this study, we propose a fine-grained preference optimization approach (FPO) to enhance the robustness of TTS systems. FPO focuses on addressing localized issues in generated samples rather than uniformly optimizing the entire utterance. Specifically, we first analyze the types of issues in generated samples, categorize them into two groups, and propose a selective training loss strategy to optimize preferences based on fine-grained labels for each issue type. Experimental results show that FPO enhances the robustness of zero-shot TTS systems by effectively addressing local issues, significantly reducing the bad case ratio, and improving intelligibility. Furthermore, FPO exhibits superior data efficiency compared with baseline systems, achieving similar performance with fewer training samples.
