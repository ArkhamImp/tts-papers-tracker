- **Abstract**: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems, quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech. We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording. To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.

- **Abstract**: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the realism and interactivity of non-player characters (NPCs) in virtual reality (VR), creating more engaging and believable user experiences. This paper evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency. Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44, indicating good usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of large language models to improve NPC realism and interaction in VR while highlighting challenges in reducing system latency and enhancing emotional depth. This research contributes to the development of more sophisticated AI-driven NPCs, revealing the need for performance optimization to achieve increasingly immersive virtual experiences.
