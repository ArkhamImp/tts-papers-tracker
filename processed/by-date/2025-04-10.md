- **Abstract**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) models can generate natural, human-like speech across multiple languages by transforming phonemes into waveforms. However, multilingual TTS remains challenging due to discrepancies in phoneme vocabularies and variations in prosody and speaking style across languages. Existing approaches either train separate models for each language, which achieve high performance at the cost of increased computational resources, or use a unified model for multiple languages that struggles to capture fine-grained, language-specific style variations. In this work, we propose LanStyleTTS, a non-autoregressive, language-aware style adaptive TTS framework that standardizes phoneme representations and enables fine-grained, phoneme-level style control across languages. This design supports a unified multilingual TTS model capable of producing accurate and high-quality speech without the need to train language-specific models. We evaluate LanStyleTTS by integrating it with several state-of-the-art non-autoregressive TTS architectures. Results show consistent performance improvements across different model backbones. Furthermore, we investigate a range of acoustic feature representations, including mel-spectrograms and autoencoder-derived latent features. Our experiments demonstrate that latent encodings can significantly reduce model size and computational cost while preserving high-quality speech generation.

- **Abstract**: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion for Persian presents unique challenges due to its complex phonological features, particularly homographs and Ezafe, which exist in formal and informal language contexts. This paper introduces an intermediate language specifically designed for Persian language processing that addresses these challenges through a multi-faceted approach. Our methodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration architecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for constructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple pronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept analysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct datasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the B-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme conversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics, establishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy. This work contributes to the growing research in low-resource language processing and provides a robust solution for Persian text-to-speech systems and demonstrating its applicability beyond Persian. Specifically, the approach can extend to languages with rich homographic phenomena such as Chinese and Arabic
