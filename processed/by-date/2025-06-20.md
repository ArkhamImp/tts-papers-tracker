- **Abstract**: Speech quality assessment (SQA) aims to evaluate the quality of speech samples without relying on time-consuming listener questionnaires. Recent efforts have focused on training neural-based SQA models to predict the mean opinion score (MOS) of speech samples produced by text-to-speech or voice conversion systems. This paper targets the enhancement of MOS prediction models' performance. We propose a novel score aggregation method to address the limitations of conventional annotations for MOS, which typically involve ratings on a scale from 1 to 5. Our method is based on the hypothesis that annotators internally consider continuous scores and then choose the nearest discrete rating. By modeling this process, we approximate the generative distribution of ratings by quantizing the latent continuous distribution. We then use the peak of this latent distribution, estimated through the loss between the quantized distribution and annotated ratings, as a new representative value instead of MOS. Experimental results demonstrate that substituting MOSNet's predicted target with this proposed value improves prediction performance.

## LM-SPT: LM-Aligned Semantic Distillation for Speech Tokenization

- **Abstract**: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents (especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste, let's talk about &lt;Hindi phrase&gt;" with uninterrupted accent shifts while preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than existing multilingual systems (p&lt;0.01). This research makes cross-lingual synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement, with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

## V-CASS: Vision-context-aware Expressive Speech Synthesis for Enhancing User Understanding of Videos
- **Authors**: Qixin Wang et.al.

- **Abstract**: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

## ZipVoice: Fast and High-Quality Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Flow Matching
- **Authors**: Han Zhu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2506.13053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13053)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, streaming, synthesis
- **Abstract**: We construct Japanese Idol Speech Corpus (JIS) to advance research in speech generation AI, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). JIS will facilitate more rigorous evaluations of speaker similarity in TTS and VC systems since all speakers in JIS belong to a highly specific category: "young female live idols" in Japan, and each speaker is identified by a stage name, enabling researchers to recruit listeners familiar with these idols for listening experiments. With its unique speaker attributes, JIS will foster compelling research, including generating voices tailored to listener preferences-an area not yet widely studied. JIS will be distributed free of charge to promote research in speech generation AI, with usage restricted to non-commercial, basic research. We describe the construction of JIS, provide an overview of Japanese live idol culture to support effective and ethical use of JIS, and offer a basic analysis to guide application of JIS.
