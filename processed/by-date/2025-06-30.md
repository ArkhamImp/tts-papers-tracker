- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

- **Abstract**: Existing large-scale zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models deliver high speech quality but suffer from slow inference speeds due to massive parameters. To address this issue, this paper introduces ZipVoice, a high-quality flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS model with a compact model size and fast inference speed. Key designs include: 1) a Zipformer-based vector field estimator to maintain adequate modeling capabilities under constrained size; 2) Average upsampling-based initial speech-text alignment and Zipformer-based text encoder to improve speech intelligibility; 3) A flow distillation method to reduce sampling steps and eliminate the inference overhead associated with classifier-free guidance. Experiments on 100k hours multilingual datasets show that ZipVoice matches state-of-the-art models in speech quality, while being 3 times smaller and up to 30 times faster than a DiT-based flow-matching baseline. Codes, model checkpoints and demo samples are publicly available at https://github.com/k2-fsa/ZipVoice.

## Efficient Interleaved Speech Modeling through Knowledge Distillation

- **Abstract**: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation, where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning (SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate. In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second, DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality loss.

- **Abstract**: Existing autoregressive large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have advantages in speech naturalness, but their token-by-token generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech. This becomes a significant limitation in applications requiring strict audio-visual synchronization, such as video dubbing. This paper introduces IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel, general, and autoregressive model-friendly method for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one explicitly specifies the number of generated tokens to precisely control speech duration; the other freely generates speech in an autoregressive manner without specifying the number of tokens, while faithfully reproducing the prosodic features of the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control over timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can accurately reconstruct the target timbre (from the timbre prompt) while perfectly reproducing the specified emotional tone (from the style prompt). To enhance speech clarity in highly emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent representations and design a novel three-stage training paradigm to improve the stability of the generated speech. Additionally, to lower the barrier for emotional control, we designed a soft instruction mechanism based on text descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3, effectively guiding the generation of speech with the desired emotional orientation. Finally, experimental results on multiple datasets show that IndexTTS2 outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in terms of word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.
