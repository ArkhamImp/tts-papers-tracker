- **Abstract**: Generalizability, the capacity of a robust model to perform effectively on unseen data, is crucial for audio deepfake detection due to the rapid evolution of text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) technologies. A promising approach to differentiate between bonafide and spoof samples lies in identifying intrinsic disparities to enhance model generalizability. From an information-theoretic perspective, we hypothesize the information content is one of the intrinsic differences: bonafide sample represents a dense, information-rich sampling of the real world, whereas spoof sample is typically derived from lower-dimensional, less informative representations. To implement this, we introduce frame-level latent information entropy detector(f-InfoED), a framework that extracts distinctive information entropy from latent representations at the frame level to identify audio deepfakes. Furthermore, we present AdaLAM, which extends large pre-trained audio models with trainable adapters for enhanced feature extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, the audio deepfake forensics 2024 (ADFF 2024) dataset was built by the latest TTS and VC methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities. Further analytical studies confirms the efficacy of AdaLAM in extracting discriminative audio features and f-InfoED in leveraging latent entropy information for more generalized deepfake detection.

## SpeechDialogueFactory: Generating High-Quality Speech Dialogue Data to Accelerate Your Speech-LLM Development

- **Abstract**: Arabic text diacritization remains a persistent challenge in natural language processing due to the language's morphological richness. In this paper, we introduce Sadeed, a novel approach based on a fine-tuned decoder-only language model adapted from Kuwain 1.5B Hennara et al. [2025], a compact model originally trained on diverse Arabic corpora. Sadeed is fine-tuned on carefully curated, high-quality diacritized datasets, constructed through a rigorous data-cleaning and normalization pipeline. Despite utilizing modest computational resources, Sadeed achieves competitive results compared to proprietary large language models and outperforms traditional models trained on similar domains. Additionally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarking practices for Arabic diacritization. To address these issues, we introduce SadeedDiac-25, a new benchmark designed to enable fairer and more comprehensive evaluation across diverse text genres and complexity levels. Together, Sadeed and SadeedDiac-25 provide a robust foundation for advancing Arabic NLP applications, including machine translation, text-to-speech, and language learning tools.

- **Abstract**: Human-AI interaction thrives on intuitive and efficient interfaces, among which voice stands out as a particularly natural and accessible modality. Recent advancements in transformer-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems, such as Fish-Speech, CosyVoice, and MegaTTS 3, have delivered remarkable improvements in quality and realism, driving a significant evolution in the TTS domain. In this paper, we introduce RWKV-7 \cite{peng2025rwkv}, a cutting-edge RNN-based architecture tailored for TTS applications. Unlike traditional transformer models, RWKV-7 leverages the strengths of recurrent neural networks to achieve greater computational efficiency and scalability, while maintaining high-quality output. Our comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that RWKV-7 outperforms transformer-based models across multiple key metrics, including synthesis speed, naturalness of speech, and resource efficiency. Furthermore, we explore its adaptability to diverse linguistic contexts and low-resource environments, showcasing its potential to democratize TTS technology. These findings position RWKV-7 as a powerful and innovative alternative, paving the way for more accessible and versatile voice synthesis solutions in real-world applications.Our code and weights are https://github.com/yynil/RWKVTTS, https://huggingface.co/spaces/RWKV-Red-Team
