## Pseudo-Autoregressive Neural Codec Language Models for Efficient Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Yifan Yang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2504.10352](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10352)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, multilingual, codec, synthesis
- **Abstract**: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.

## AutoStyle-TTS: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Automatic Style Matching Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Dan Luo et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2504.10309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10309)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based architecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.

## SafeSpeech: Robust and Universal Voice Protection Against Malicious Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Zhisheng Zhang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2504.09839](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09839)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: With the advancement of speech synthesis technology, users have higher expectations for the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech. But previous research ignores the importance of prompt selection. This study proposes a text-to-speech (TTS) framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which can dynamically adjust the speech style according to the text content to achieve more natural and vivid communication effects. We have constructed a speech style knowledge database containing high-quality speech samples in various contexts and developed a style matching scheme. This scheme uses embeddings, extracted by Llama, PER-LLM-Embedder,and Moka, to match with samples in the knowledge database, selecting the most appropriate speech style for synthesis. Furthermore, our empirical research validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our demo can be viewed at: https://thuhcsi.github.io/icme2025-AutoStyle-TTS
