## Fed-PISA: Federated Voice Cloning via Personalized Identity-Style Adaptation

- **Abstract**: The pipeline for multi-participant audiobook production primarily consists of three stages: script analysis, character voice timbre selection, and speech synthesis. Among these, script analysis can be automated with high accuracy using NLP models, whereas character voice timbre selection still relies on manual effort. Speech synthesis uses either manual dubbing or text-to-speech (TTS). While TTS boosts efficiency, it struggles with emotional expression, intonation control, and contextual scene adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose DeepDubbing, an end-to-end automated system for multi-participant audiobook production. The system comprises two main components: a Text-to-Timbre (TTT) model and a Context-Aware Instruct-TTS (CA-Instruct-TTS) model. The TTT model generates role-specific timbre embeddings conditioned on text descriptions. The CA-Instruct-TTS model synthesizes expressive speech by analyzing contextual dialogue and incorporating fine-grained emotional instructions. This system enables the automated generation of multi-participant audiobooks with both timbre-matched character voices and emotionally expressive narration, offering a novel solution for audiobook production.

## VoXtream: Full-Stream Text-to-Speech with Extremely Low Latency

- **Abstract**: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer (LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.

## Deep Dubbing: End-to-End Auto-Audiobook System with Text-to-Timbre and Context-Aware Instruct-TTS
- **Authors**: Ziqi Dai et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.15845](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15845)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: The goal of this paper is to introduce SPADE, a framework for Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient Large Language Model-based text-to-speech (LLM-TTS). Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation.

## LibriTTS-VI: A Public Corpus and Novel Methods for Efficient Voice Impression Control

- **Abstract**: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment. Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work, we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds, whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

## Beyond Video-to-SFX: Video to Audio Synthesis with Environmentally Aware Speech
- **Authors**: Xinlei Niu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.15492](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15492)
- **Tags**: other
- **Abstract**: This paper focuses on resolving stability hallucinations (e.g., repetitive or omitted speech) in LLM-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models by improving and leveraging the attention mechanism. First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.
