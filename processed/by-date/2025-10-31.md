- **Abstract**: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely, expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma 3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality, emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory ecosystem.
