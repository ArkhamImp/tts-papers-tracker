- **Abstract**: In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.

## Mitigating Hallucinations in LM-Based TTS Models via Distribution Alignment Using GFlowNets

- **Abstract**: We present a system for automatic multi-axis perceptual quality prediction of generative audio, developed for Track 2 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025. The task is to predict four Audio Aesthetic Scores--Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness--for audio generated by text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-audio (TTA), and text-to-music (TTM) systems. A main challenge is the domain shift between natural training data and synthetic evaluation data. To address this, we combine BEATs, a pretrained transformer-based audio representation model, with a multi-branch long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor and use a triplet loss with buffer-based sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. Our results show that this improves embedding discriminability and generalization, enabling domain-robust audio quality assessment without synthetic training data.
