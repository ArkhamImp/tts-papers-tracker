- **Abstract**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems face ongoing challenges in processing complex linguistic features, handling polyphonic expressions, and producing natural-sounding multilingual speech - capabilities that are crucial for future AI applications. In this paper, we present Fish-Speech, a novel framework that implements a serial fast-slow Dual Autoregressive (Dual-AR) architecture to enhance the stability of Grouped Finite Scalar Vector Quantization (GFSQ) in sequence generation tasks. This architecture improves codebook processing efficiency while maintaining high-fidelity outputs, making it particularly effective for AI interactions and voice cloning. Fish-Speech leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for linguistic feature extraction, eliminating the need for traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion and thereby streamlining the synthesis pipeline and enhancing multilingual support. Additionally, we developed FF-GAN through GFSQ to achieve superior compression ratios and near 100\% codebook utilization. Our approach addresses key limitations of current TTS systems while providing a foundation for more sophisticated, context-aware speech synthesis. Experimental results show that Fish-Speech significantly outperforms baseline models in handling complex linguistic scenarios and voice cloning tasks, demonstrating its potential to advance TTS technology in AI applications. The implementation is open source at \href{https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech}{https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech}.

- **Abstract**: Prosody contains rich information beyond the literal meaning of words, which is crucial for the intelligibility of speech. Current models still fall short in phrasing and intonation; they not only miss or misplace breaks when synthesizing long sentences with complex structures but also produce unnatural intonation. We propose ProsodyFM, a prosody-aware text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model with a flow-matching (FM) backbone that aims to enhance the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody. ProsodyFM introduces two key components: a Phrase Break Encoder to capture initial phrase break locations, followed by a Duration Predictor for the flexible adjustment of break durations; and a Terminal Intonation Encoder which learns a bank of intonation shape tokens combined with a novel Pitch Processor for more robust modeling of human-perceived intonation change. ProsodyFM is trained with no explicit prosodic labels and yet can uncover a broad spectrum of break durations and intonation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that ProsodyFM can effectively improve the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody, thereby enhancing the overall intelligibility compared to four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Out-of-distribution experiments show that this prosody improvement can further bring ProsodyFM superior generalizability for unseen complex sentences and speakers. Our case study intuitively illustrates the powerful and fine-grained controllability of ProsodyFM over phrasing and intonation.
