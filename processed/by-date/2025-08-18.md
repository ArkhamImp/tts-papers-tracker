- **Abstract**: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

## Integrating Feedback Loss from Bi-modal Sarcasm Detector for Sarcastic Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Marco-Voice and https://huggingface.co/datasets/AIDC-AI/CSEMOTIONS respectively.

## Real-Time Sign Language Gestures to Speech Transcription using Deep Learning

- **Tags**: streaming, multilingual
- **Abstract**: Achieving natural and human-like speech synthesis with low inference costs remains a major challenge in speech synthesis research. This study focuses on human prosodic patterns and synthesized spectrum harmony, addressing the challenges of prosody modeling and artifact issues in non-autoregressive models. To enhance prosody modeling and synthesis quality, we introduce a new Duration Predictor based on the Mixture of Experts alongside a new Vocoder with two advanced multi-scale discriminators. We integrated the these new modules into the VITS system, forming our FNH-TTS system. Our experiments on LJSpeech, VCTK, and LibriTTS demonstrate the system's superiority in synthesis quality, phoneme duration prediction, Vocoder results, and synthesis speed. Our prosody visualization results show that FNH-TTS produces duration predictions that more closely align with natural human beings than other systems.
