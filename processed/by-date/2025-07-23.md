- **Abstract**: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line, while non-autoregressive end to end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction framework that can give promising phoneme-level duration distribution with given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise prediction and adaptation ability to conditions, compared to previous baseline models. Specifically, it makes a considerable improvement on phoneme-level alignment accuracy and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

- **Abstract**: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics. We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete features that improve overall controllability of the model.

- **Abstract**: The rapid surge of text-to-speech and face-voice reenactment models makes video fabrication easier and highly realistic. To encounter this problem, we require datasets that rich in type of generation methods and perturbation strategy which is usually common for online videos. To this end, we propose AV-Deepfake1M++, an extension of the AV-Deepfake1M having 2 million video clips with diversified manipulation strategy and audio-visual perturbation. This paper includes the description of data generation strategies along with benchmarking of AV-Deepfake1M++ using state-of-the-art methods. We believe that this dataset will play a pivotal role in facilitating research in Deepfake domain. Based on this dataset, we host the 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. The challenge details, dataset and evaluation scripts are available online under a research-only license at https://deepfakes1m.github.io/2025.
