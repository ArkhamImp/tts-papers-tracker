- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation. Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining, bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.

- **Abstract**: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading via hand coding, offering visual phonemic cues that support precise speech perception for the hearing-impaired. The task of CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) aims to convert CS videos into intelligible speech signals. Most existing research focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which transcribes video content into text. Consequently, a common solution for CSV2S is to integrate CSR with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics. In contrast, directly generating audio speech from CS video (direct CSV2S) often suffers from the inherent multimodal complexity and the limited availability of CS data. To address these challenges, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. The core innovation of UniCUE lies in integrating an understanding task (CSR) that provides fine-grained CS visual-semantic cues to guide speech generation. Specifically, UniCUE incorporates a pose-aware visual processor, a semantic alignment pool that enables precise visual-semantic mapping, and a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge the understanding and generation tasks within a unified architecture. To support this framework, we construct UniCUE-HI, a large-scale Mandarin CS dataset containing 11282 videos from 14 cuers, including both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

- **Abstract**: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural, high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

- **Abstract**: Punctuation plays a vital role in structuring meaning, yet current models often struggle to restore it accurately in transcripts of spontaneous speech, especially in the presence of disfluencies such as false starts and backtracking. These limitations hinder the performance of downstream tasks like translation, text to speech, summarization, etc. where sentence boundaries are critical for preserving quality. In this work, we introduce Cadence, a generalist punctuation restoration model adapted from a pretrained large language model. Cadence is designed to handle both clean written text and highly spontaneous spoken transcripts. It surpasses the previous state of the art in performance while expanding support from 14 to all 22 Indian languages and English. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of model behavior across punctuation types and language families, identifying persistent challenges under domain shift and with rare punctuation marks. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing pretrained language models for multilingual punctuation restoration and highlight Cadence practical value for low resource NLP pipelines at scale.

- **Abstract**: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems are constrained by existing datasets that typically cover only 6-10 basic emotions, lack scale and diversity, and face ethical challenges when collecting sensitive emotional states. We introduce EMONET-VOICE, a comprehensive resource addressing these limitations through two components: (1) EmoNet-Voice Big, a 5,000-hour multilingual pre-training dataset spanning 40 fine-grained emotion categories across 11 voices and 4 languages, and (2) EmoNet-Voice Bench, a rigorously validated benchmark of 4,7k samples with unanimous expert consensus on emotion presence and intensity levels. Using state-of-the-art synthetic voice generation, our privacy-preserving approach enables ethical inclusion of sensitive emotions (e.g., pain, shame) while maintaining controlled experimental conditions. Each sample underwent validation by three psychology experts. We demonstrate that our Empathic Insight models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong real-world dataset generalization, as tested on EmoDB and RAVDESS. Furthermore, our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while high-arousal emotions (e.g., anger: 95% accuracy) are readily detected, the benchmark successfully exposes the difficulty of distinguishing perceptually similar emotions (e.g., sadness vs. distress: 63% discrimination), providing quantifiable metrics for advancing nuanced emotion AI. EMONET-VOICE establishes a new paradigm for large-scale, ethically-sourced, fine-grained SER research.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

- **Abstract**: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.
