- **Abstract**: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) and singing voice conversion (SVC) have achieved remarkable progress in generating natural-sounding human singing. However, existing systems are restricted to human timbres and have limited ability to synthesize voices outside the human range, which are increasingly demanded in creative applications such as video games, movies, and virtual characters. We introduce Non-Human Singing Generation (NHSG), covering non-human singing voice synthesis (NHSVS) and non-human singing voice conversion (NHSVC), as a novel machine learning task for generating musically coherent singing with non-human timbral characteristics. NHSG is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of non-human singing data, the lack of symbolic alignment, and the wide timbral gap between human and non-human voices. To address these challenges, we propose CartoonSing, a unified framework that integrates singing voice synthesis and conversion while bridging human and non-human singing generation. CartoonSing employs a two-stage pipeline: a score representation encoder trained with annotated human singing and a timbre-aware vocoder that reconstructs waveforms for both human and non-human audio. Experiments demonstrate that CartoonSing successfully generates non-human singing voices, generalizes to novel timbres, and extends conventional SVS and SVC toward creative, non-human singing generation.

## Codec2Vec: Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning Using Neural Speech Codecs

- **Abstract**: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

## SceneGuard: Training-Time Voice Protection with Scene-Consistent Audible Background Noise

- **Abstract**: This paper addresses the challenges in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain subband adaptive filtering, in particular, subband system identification. Previous studies in this area have primarily focused on setups with subband filtering at a downsampled rate, implemented using the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) filter bank, popular in audio and speech-processing for its reduced complexity. However, this traditional approach imposes constraints on the subband filters when transformed to their full-rate representation. This paper makes three key contributions. First, it introduces a generalized WOLA filter bank that repositions subband filters before the downsampling operation, eliminating the constraints on subband filters inherent in the conventional WOLA filter bank. Second, it investigates the mean square error (MSE) performance of the generalized WOLA filter bank for full-band system identification, establishing analytical ties between the order of subband filters, the full-band system impulse response length, the decimation factor, and the prototype filters. Third, to address the increased computational complexity of the generalized WOLA, the paper proposes a low-complexity implementation termed per-tone weighted overlap-add (PT-WOLA), which maintains computational complexity on par with conventional WOLA. Analytical and empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed generalized WOLA filter bank significantly enhances the performance of subband system identification.
