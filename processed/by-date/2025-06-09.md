- **Abstract**: The rise of deepfake audio and hate speech, powered by advanced text-to-speech, threatens online safety. We present SynHate, the first multilingual dataset for detecting hate speech in synthetic audio, spanning 37 languages. SynHate uses a novel four-class scheme: Real-normal, Real-hate, Fake-normal, and Fake-hate. Built from MuTox and ADIMA datasets, it captures diverse hate speech patterns globally and in India. We evaluate five leading self-supervised models (Whisper-small/medium, XLS-R, AST, mHuBERT), finding notable performance differences by language, with Whisper-small performing best overall. Cross-dataset generalization remains a challenge. By releasing SynHate and baseline code, we aim to advance robust, culturally sensitive, and multilingual solutions against synthetic hate speech. The dataset is available at https://www.iab-rubric.org/resources.

## Transcript-Prompted Whisper with Dictionary-Enhanced Decoding for Japanese Speech Annotation

- **Abstract**: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.

## Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS
- **Authors**: Keinichi Fujita et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2506.05688](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05688)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Controllable TTS models with natural language prompts often lack the ability for fine-grained control and face a scarcity of high-quality data. We propose a two-stage style-controllable TTS system with language models, utilizing a quantized masked-autoencoded style-rich representation as an intermediary. In the first stage, an autoregressive transformer is used for the conditional generation of these style-rich tokens from text and control signals. The second stage generates codec tokens from both text and sampled style-rich tokens. Experiments show that training the first-stage model on extensive datasets enhances the content robustness of the two-stage model as well as control capabilities over multiple attributes. By selectively combining discrete labels and speaker embeddings, we explore fully controlling the speaker's timbre and other stylistic information, and adjusting attributes like emotion for a specified speaker.
