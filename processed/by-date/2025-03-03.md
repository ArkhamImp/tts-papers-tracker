- **Abstract**: Video-to-speech (V2S) synthesis, the task of generating speech directly from silent video input, is inherently more challenging than other speech synthesis tasks due to the need to accurately reconstruct both speech content and speaker characteristics from visual cues alone. Recently, audio-visual pre-training has eliminated the need for additional acoustic hints in V2S, which previous methods often relied on to ensure training convergence. However, even with pre-training, existing methods continue to face challenges in achieving a balance between acoustic intelligibility and the preservation of speaker-specific characteristics. We analyzed this limitation and were motivated to introduce DiVISe (Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis), an end-to-end V2S model that predicts Mel-spectrograms directly from video frames alone. Despite not taking any acoustic hints, DiVISe effectively preserves speaker characteristics in the generated audio, and achieves superior performance on both objective and subjective metrics across the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that DiVISe not only outperforms existing V2S models in acoustic intelligibility but also scales more effectively with increased data and model parameters.

## Spark-TTS: An Efficient LLM-Based Text-to-Speech Model with Single-Stream Decoupled Speech Tokens

- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.

## Voice Cloning for Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Addressing Data Scarcity in Speech-Language Pathology
- **Authors**: Birger Moell et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2503.01266](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01266)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Speech-comprehension difficulties are common among older people. Standard speech tests do not fully capture such difficulties because the tests poorly resemble the context-rich, story-like nature of ongoing conversation and are typically available only in a country's dominant/official language (e.g., English), leading to inaccurate scores for native speakers of other languages. Assessments for naturalistic, story speech in multiple languages require accurate, time-efficient scoring. The current research leverages modern large language models (LLMs) in native English speakers and native speakers of 10 other languages to automate the generation of high-quality, spoken stories and scoring of speech recall in different languages. Participants listened to and freely recalled short stories (in quiet/clear and in babble noise) in their native language. LLM text-embeddings and LLM prompt engineering with semantic similarity analyses to score speech recall revealed sensitivity to known effects of temporal order, primacy/recency, and background noise, and high similarity of recall scores across languages. The work overcomes limitations associated with simple speech materials and testing of closed native-speaker groups because recall data of varying length and details can be mapped across languages with high accuracy. The full automation of speech generation and recall scoring provides an important step towards comprehension assessments of naturalistic speech with clinical applicability.
