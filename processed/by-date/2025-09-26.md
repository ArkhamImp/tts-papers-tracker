- **Abstract**: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) based autoregressive (AR) text-to-speech (TTS) systems, while achieving state-of-the-art quality, still face critical challenges. The foundation of this LLM-based paradigm is the discretization of the continuous speech waveform into a sequence of discrete tokens by neural audio codec. However, single codebook modeling is well suited to text LLMs, but suffers from significant information loss; hierarchical acoustic tokens, typically generated via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), often lack explicit semantic structure, placing a heavy learning burden on the model. Furthermore, the autoregressive process is inherently susceptible to error accumulation, which can degrade generation stability. To address these limitations, we propose CaT-TTS, a novel framework for robust and semantically-grounded zero-shot synthesis. First, we introduce S3Codec, a split RVQ codec that injects explicit linguistic features into its primary codebook via semantic distillation from a state-of-the-art ASR model, providing a structured representation that simplifies the learning task. Second, we propose an ``Understand-then-Generate'' dual-Transformer architecture that decouples comprehension from rendering. An initial ``Understanding'' Transformer models the cross-modal relationship between text and the audio's semantic tokens to form a high-level utterance plan. A subsequent ``Generation'' Transformer then executes this plan, autoregressively synthesizing hierarchical acoustic tokens. Finally, to enhance generation stability, we introduce Masked Audio Parallel Inference (MAPI), a nearly parameter-free inference strategy that dynamically guides the decoding process to mitigate local errors.

## Semantic-VAE: Semantic-Alignment Latent Representation for Better Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

## Speaker Anonymisation for Speech-based Suicide Risk Detection

- **Abstract**: Due to the rapid progress of speech synthesis, deepfake detection has become a major concern in the speech processing community. Because it is a critical task, systems must not only be efficient and robust, but also provide interpretable explanations. Among the different approaches for explainability, we focus on the interpretation of latent representations. In such paper, we focus on the last layer of embeddings of AASIST, a deepfake detection architecture. We use a TopK activation inspired by SAEs on this layer to obtain sparse representations which are used in the decision process. We demonstrate that sparse deepfake detection can improve detection performance, with an EER of 23.36% on ASVSpoof5 test set, with 95% of sparsity. We then show that these representations provide better disentanglement, using completeness and modularity metrics based on mutual information. Notably, some attacks are directly encoded in the latent space.

## Comprehend and Talk: Text to Speech Synthesis via Dual Language Modeling

- **Tags**: multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Current emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) and style transfer methods rely on reference encoders to control global style or emotion vectors, but do not capture nuanced acoustic details of the reference speech. To this end, we propose a novel emotional TTS method that enables fine-grained phoneme-level emotion embedding prediction while disentangling intrinsic attributes of the reference speech. The proposed method employs a style disentanglement method to guide two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and emotion features, and effectively separating distinct style components from the reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline TTS systems in generating natural and emotionally rich speech. This work highlights the potential of disentangled and fine-grained representations in advancing the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.

## Align2Speak: Improving TTS for Low Resource Languages via ASR-Guided Online Preference Optimization

- **Tags**: streaming, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Generative models for speech synthesis face a fundamental trade-off: discrete tokens ensure stability but sacrifice expressivity, while continuous signals retain acoustic richness but suffer from error accumulation due to task entanglement. This challenge has driven the field towards multi-stage pipelines that rely on pre-trained speech tokenizers, but these create a semantic-acoustic divide, limiting holistic and expressive speech generation. We resolve these dilemma through hierarchical semantic-acoustic modeling with semi-discrete residual representations and present a novel tokenizer-free TTS model VoxCPM. Our framework introduces a differentiable quantization bottleneck that induces natural specialization: a Text-Semantic Language Model (TSLM) generates semantic-prosodic plans, while a Residual Acoustic Model (RALM) recovers fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical semantic-acoustic representation guides a local diffusion-based decoder to generate high-fidelity speech latents. Critically, the entire architecture is trained end-to-end under a simple diffusion objective, eliminating dependency on external speech tokenizers. Trained on a massive 1.8 million hours of bilingual corpus, our VoxCPM-0.5B model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS performance among open-source systems, demonstrating that our approach delivers expressive and stable synthesis. Besides, VoxCPM shows the capability to comprehend text to infer and generate appropriate prosody and style, delivering speech with context-aware expressiveness and natural flow. To facilitate community-driven research and development, VoxCPM is publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

## SPADE: Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient LLM-TTS
- **Authors**: Tan Dat Nguyen et.al.

- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.
