## Vox-Evaluator: Enhancing Stability and Fidelity for Zero-shot TTS with A Multi-Level Evaluator
- **Authors**: Hualei Wang et.al.

- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: We propose \textbf{U-Codec}, an \textbf{U}ltra low frame-rate neural speech \textbf{Codec} that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and fast speech generation at an extremely low frame-rate of 5Hz (5 frames per second). Extreme compression at 5Hz typically leads to severe intelligibility and spectral detail loss, we introduce a Transformer-based inter-frame long-term dependency module and systematically explore residual vector quantization (RVQ) depth and codebook size to identify optimal configurations. Moreover, we apply U-Codec into a large language model (LLM)-based auto-regressive TTS model, which leverages global and local hierarchical architecture to effectively capture dependencies across multi-layer tokens. We extend LLM-based TTS from 3-layer RVQ at 50Hz to 32-layer RVQ at 5Hz. Experimental results demonstrate that U-Codec improves LLM-based TTS inference speed by around 3 $\times$ over high-frame-rate codecs while maintaining similarity and naturalness. These results validate the feasibility of using highly compressed 5Hz discrete tokens for fast and high-fidelity speech synthesis.

## SpeechAgent: An End-to-End Mobile Infrastructure for Speech Impairment Assistance

- **Abstract**: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.
