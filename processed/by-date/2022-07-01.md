- **Abstract**: Polyphone disambiguation aims to capture accurate pronunciation knowledge from natural text sequences for reliable Text-to-speech (TTS) systems. However, previous approaches require substantial annotated training data and additional efforts from language experts, making it difficult to extend high-quality neural TTS systems to out-of-domain daily conversations and countless languages worldwide. This paper tackles the polyphone disambiguation problem from a concise and novel perspective: we propose Dict-TTS, a semantic-aware generative text-to-speech model with an online website dictionary (the existing prior information in the natural language). Specifically, we design a semantics-to-pronunciation attention (S2PA) module to match the semantic patterns between the input text sequence and the prior semantics in the dictionary and obtain the corresponding pronunciations; The S2PA module can be easily trained with the end-to-end TTS model without any annotated phoneme labels. Experimental results in three languages show that our model outperforms several strong baseline models in terms of pronunciation accuracy and improves the prosody modeling of TTS systems. Further extensive analyses demonstrate that each design in Dict-TTS is effective. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Zain-Jiang/Dict-TTS}.

## Building African Voices

- **Abstract**: Current text to speech (TTS) systems usually leverage a cascaded acoustic model and vocoder pipeline with mel-spectrograms as the intermediate representations, which suffer from two limitations: 1) the acoustic model and vocoder are separately trained instead of jointly optimized, which incurs cascaded errors; 2) the intermediate speech representations (e.g., mel-spectrogram) are pre-designed and lose phase information, which are sub-optimal. To solve these problems, in this paper, we develop DelightfulTTS 2, a new end-to-end speech synthesis system with automatically learned speech representations and jointly optimized acoustic model and vocoder. Specifically, 1) we propose a new codec network based on vector-quantized auto-encoders with adversarial training (VQ-GAN) to extract intermediate frame-level speech representations (instead of traditional representations like mel-spectrograms) and reconstruct speech waveform; 2) we jointly optimize the acoustic model (based on DelightfulTTS) and the vocoder (the decoder of VQ-GAN), with an auxiliary loss on the acoustic model to predict intermediate speech representations. Experiments show that DelightfulTTS 2 achieves a CMOS gain +0.14 over DelightfulTTS, and more method analyses further verify the effectiveness of the developed system.

## Automatic Evaluation of Speaker Similarity

- **Abstract**: Some recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of single-stage neural text-to-speech, which does not need to generate mel-spectrograms but generates the raw waveforms directly from the text. Single-stage text-to-speech often faces two problems: a) the one-to-many mapping problem due to multiple speech variations and b) insufficiency of high frequency reconstruction due to the lack of supervision of ground-truth acoustic features during training. To solve the a) problem and generate more expressive speech, we propose a novel phoneme-level prosody modeling method based on a variational autoencoder with normalizing flows to model underlying prosodic information in speech. We also use the prosody predictor to support end-to-end expressive speech synthesis. Furthermore, we propose the dual parallel autoencoder to introduce supervision of the ground-truth acoustic features during training to solve the b) problem enabling our model to generate high-quality speech. We compare the synthesis quality with state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems on an internal expressive English dataset. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method for lossless speech generation while also showing a strong capability in prosody modeling.

## Language Model-Based Emotion Prediction Methods for Emotional Speech Synthesis Systems
- **Authors**: Hyun-Wook Yoon et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2206.15067](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15067)
- **Tags**: expressive, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: BibleTTS is a large, high-quality, open speech dataset for ten languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa. The corpus contains up to 86 hours of aligned, studio quality 48kHz single speaker recordings per language, enabling the development of high-quality text-to-speech models. The ten languages represented are: Akuapem Twi, Asante Twi, Chichewa, Ewe, Hausa, Kikuyu, Lingala, Luganda, Luo, and Yoruba. This corpus is a derivative work of Bible recordings made and released by the Open.Bible project from Biblica. We have aligned, cleaned, and filtered the original recordings, and additionally hand-checked a subset of the alignments for each language. We present results for text-to-speech models with Coqui TTS. The data is released under a commercial-friendly CC-BY-SA license.

## JETS: Jointly Training FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN for End to End Text to Speech
- **Authors**: Dan Lim et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2203.16852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16852)
- **Tags**: streaming
- **Abstract**: We propose a novel deliberation-based approach to end-to-end (E2E) spoken language understanding (SLU), where a streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) model produces the first-pass hypothesis and a second-pass natural language understanding (NLU) component generates the semantic parse by conditioning on both ASR's text and audio embeddings. By formulating E2E SLU as a generalized decoder, our system is able to support complex compositional semantic structures. Furthermore, the sharing of parameters between ASR and NLU makes the system especially suitable for resource-constrained (on-device) environments; our proposed approach consistently outperforms strong pipeline NLU baselines by 0.60% to 0.65% on the spoken version of the TOPv2 dataset (STOP). We demonstrate that the fusion of text and audio features, coupled with the system's ability to rewrite the first-pass hypothesis, makes our approach more robust to ASR errors. Finally, we show that our approach can significantly reduce the degradation when moving from natural speech to synthetic speech training, but more work is required to make text-to-speech (TTS) a viable solution for scaling up E2E SLU.
