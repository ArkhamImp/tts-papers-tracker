- **Abstract**: We present CS-FLEURS, a new dataset for developing and evaluating code-switched speech recognition and translation systems beyond high-resourced languages. CS-FLEURS consists of 4 test sets which cover in total 113 unique code-switched language pairs across 52 languages: 1) a 14 X-English language pair set with real voices reading synthetically generated code-switched sentences, 2) a 16 X-English language pair set with generative text-to-speech 3) a 60 {Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish}-X language pair set with the generative text-to-speech, and 4) a 45 X-English lower-resourced language pair test set with concatenative text-to-speech. Besides the four test sets, CS-FLEURS also provides a training set with 128 hours of generative text-to-speech data across 16 X-English language pairs. Our hope is that CS-FLEURS helps to broaden the scope of future code-switched speech research. Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/byan/cs-fleurs.
