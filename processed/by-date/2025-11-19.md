- **Abstract**: Recent advances in generative AI for music have achieved remarkable fidelity and stylistic diversity, yet these systems often fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to the specific loss functions they use. This paper advocates for the systematic application of preference alignment techniques to music generation, addressing the fundamental gap between computational optimization and human musical appreciation. Drawing on recent breakthroughs including MusicRL's large-scale preference learning, multi-preference alignment frameworks like diffusion-based preference optimization in DiffRhythm+, and inference-time optimization techniques like Text2midi-InferAlign, we discuss how these techniques can address music's unique challenges: temporal coherence, harmonic consistency, and subjective quality assessment. We identify key research challenges including scalability to long-form compositions, reliability amongst others in preference modelling. Looking forward, we envision preference-aligned music generation enabling transformative applications in interactive composition tools and personalized music services. This work calls for sustained interdisciplinary research combining advances in machine learning, music-theory to create music AI systems that truly serve human creative and experiential needs.

- **Abstract**: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a paradigm shift in mobile edge computing, where intelligent agents operate autonomously in dynamic, resource-constrained environments. However, the deployment of advanced agentic AI models on mobile and edge devices faces significant challenges due to limited computation, energy, and storage resources. To address these constraints, this survey investigates the integration of Knowledge Distillation (KD) into EGI, positioning KD as a key enabler for efficient, communication-aware, and scalable intelligence at the wireless edge. In particular, we emphasize KD techniques specifically designed for wireless communication and mobile networking, such as channel-aware self-distillation, cross-model Channel State Information (CSI) feedback distillation, and robust modulation/classification distillation. Furthermore, we review novel architectures natively suited for KD and edge deployment, such as Mamba, RWKV (Receptance, Weight, Key, Value) and Cross-Architecture distillation, which enhance generalization capabilities. Subsequently, we examine diverse applications in which KD-driven architectures enable EGI across vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. Finally, we highlight the key challenges and future directions for KD in EGI. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers exploring KD-driven frameworks for mobile agentic AI in the era of EGI.

## PresentCoach: Dual-Agent Presentation Coaching through Exemplars and Interactive Feedback

- **Abstract**: We introduce AIRHILT (Aviation Integrated Reasoning, Human-in-the-Loop Testbed), a modular and lightweight simulation environment designed to evaluate multimodal pilot and air traffic control (ATC) assistance systems for aviation conflict detection. Built on the open-source Godot engine, AIRHILT synchronizes pilot and ATC radio communications, visual scene understanding from camera streams, and ADS-B surveillance data within a unified, scalable platform. The environment supports pilot- and controller-in-the-loop interactions, providing a comprehensive scenario suite covering both terminal area and en route operational conflicts, including communication errors and procedural mistakes. AIRHILT offers standardized JSON-based interfaces that enable researchers to easily integrate, swap, and evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR), visual detection, decision-making, and text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate AIRHILT through a reference pipeline incorporating fine-tuned Whisper ASR, YOLO-based visual detection, ADS-B-based conflict logic, and GPT-OSS-20B structured reasoning, and present preliminary results from representative runway-overlap scenarios, where the assistant achieves an average time-to-first-warning of approximately 7.7 s, with average ASR and vision latencies of approximately 5.9 s and 0.4 s, respectively. The AIRHILT environment and scenario suite are openly available, supporting reproducible research on multimodal situational awareness and conflict detection in aviation; code and scenarios are available at https://github.com/ogarib3/airhilt.

## Auden-Voice: General-Purpose Voice Encoder for Speech and Language Understanding

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models made it possible to achieve high conversational performance with substantially reduced computational demands, enabling practical on-site deployment in clinical environments. Such progress allows for local integration of AI systems that uphold strict data protection and patient privacy requirements, yet their secure implementation in medicine necessitates careful consideration of ethical, regulatory, and technical constraints. In this study, we introduce MedChat, a locally deployable virtual physician framework that integrates an LLM-based medical chatbot with a diffusion-driven avatar for automated and structured anamnesis. The chatbot was fine-tuned using a hybrid corpus of real and synthetically generated medical dialogues, while model efficiency was optimized via Low-Rank Adaptation. A secure and isolated database interface was implemented to ensure complete separation between patient data and the inference process. The avatar component was realized through a conditional diffusion model operating in latent space, trained on researcher video datasets and synchronized with mel-frequency audio features for realistic speech and facial animation. Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis. The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data. The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.

## Aligning Generative Music AI with Human Preferences: Methods and Challenges

- **Abstract**: Voice cloning technology poses significant privacy threats by enabling unauthorized speech synthesis from limited audio samples. Existing defenses based on imperceptible adversarial perturbations are vulnerable to common audio preprocessing such as denoising and compression. We propose SceneGuard, a training-time voice protection method that applies scene-consistent audible background noise to speech recordings. Unlike imperceptible perturbations, SceneGuard leverages naturally occurring acoustic scenes (e.g., airport, street, park) to create protective noise that is contextually appropriate and robust to countermeasures. We evaluate SceneGuard on text-to-speech training attacks, demonstrating 5.5% speaker similarity degradation with extremely high statistical significance (p &lt; 10^{-15}, Cohen's d = 2.18) while preserving 98.6% speech intelligibility (STOI = 0.986). Robustness evaluation shows that SceneGuard maintains or enhances protection under five common countermeasures including MP3 compression, spectral subtraction, lowpass filtering, and downsampling. Our results suggest that audible, scene-consistent noise provides a more robust alternative to imperceptible perturbations for training-time voice protection.
