- **Abstract**: Autoregressive~(AR) generation almost dominates sequence generation for its efficacy. Recently, non-autoregressive~(NAR) generation gains increasing popularity for its efficiency and growing efficacy. However, its efficiency is still bottlenecked by quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, which is prohibitive for scaling to long sequence generation and few works have been done to mitigate this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel MLP variant, \textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{L}ayer \textbf{P}erceptron~(AMLP), to produce a generation model with linear time and space complexity. Different from classic MLP with static and learnable projection matrices, AMLP leverages adaptive projections computed from inputs in an attentive mode. The sample-aware adaptive projections enable communications among tokens in a sequence, and model the measurement between the query and key space. Furthermore, we marry AMLP with popular NAR models, deriving a highly efficient NAR-AMLP architecture with linear time and space complexity. Empirical results show that such marriage architecture surpasses competitive efficient NAR models, by a significant margin on text-to-speech synthesis and machine translation. We also test AMLP's self- and cross-attention ability separately with extensive ablation experiments, and find them comparable or even superior to the other efficient models. The efficiency analysis further shows that AMLP extremely reduces the memory cost against vanilla non-autoregressive models for long sequences.

- **Abstract**: In current two-stage neural text-to-speech (TTS) paradigm, it is ideal to have a universal neural vocoder, once trained, which is robust to imperfect mel-spectrogram predicted from the acoustic model. To this end, we propose Robust MelGAN vocoder by solving the original multi-band MelGAN's metallic sound problem and increasing its generalization ability. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained network dropout strategy to the generator. With a specifically designed over-smooth handler which separates speech signal intro periodic and aperiodic components, we only perform network dropout to the aperodic components, which alleviates metallic sounding and maintains good speaker similarity. To further improve generalization ability, we introduce several data augmentation methods to augment fake data in the discriminator, including harmonic shift, harmonic noise and phase noise. Experiments show that Robust MelGAN can be used as a universal vocoder, significantly improving sound quality in TTS systems built on various types of data.
