- **Abstract**: Autoregressive (AR) frameworks have recently achieved remarkable progress in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) by leveraging discrete speech tokens and large language model techniques. Despite their success, existing AR-based zero-shot TTS systems face two critical limitations: (i) an inherent speed-quality trade-off, as sequential token generation either reduces frame rates at the cost of expressiveness or enriches tokens at the cost of efficiency, and (ii) a text-oriented supervision mismatch, as cross-entropy loss penalizes token errors uniformly without considering the fine-grained acoustic similarity among adjacent tokens. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeTTS, a novel AR-TTS framework built upon the dual speech representation paradigm BridgeCode. BridgeTTS reduces AR iterations by predicting sparse tokens while reconstructing rich continuous features for high-quality synthesis. Joint optimization of token-level and feature-level objectives further enhances naturalness and intelligibility. Experiments demonstrate that BridgeTTS achieves competitive quality and speaker similarity while significantly accelerating synthesis. Speech demos are available at https://test1562.github.io/demo/.

- **Abstract**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

## MRSAudio: A Large-Scale Multimodal Recorded Spatial Audio Dataset with Refined Annotations

- **Abstract**: Neural speech synthesis techniques have enabled highly realistic speech deepfakes, posing major security risks. Speech deepfake detection is challenging due to distribution shifts across spoofing methods and variability in speakers, channels, and recording conditions. We explore learning shared discriminative features as a path to robust detection and propose Information Bottleneck enhanced Confidence-Aware Adversarial Network (IB-CAAN). Confidence-guided adversarial alignment adaptively suppresses attack-specific artifacts without erasing discriminative cues, while the information bottleneck removes nuisance variability to preserve transferable features. Experiments on ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild demonstrate that IB-CAAN consistently outperforms baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks.
