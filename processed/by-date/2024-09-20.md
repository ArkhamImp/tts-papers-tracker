- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)

- **Abstract**: The use of synthetic speech as data augmentation is gaining increasing popularity in fields such as automatic speech recognition and speech classification tasks. Despite novel text-to-speech systems with voice cloning capabilities, that allow the usage of a larger amount of voices based on short audio segments, it is known that these systems tend to hallucinate and oftentimes produce bad data that will most likely have a negative impact on the downstream task. In the present work, we conduct a set of experiments around zero-shot learning with synthetic speech data for the specific task of speech commands classification. Our results on the Google Speech Commands dataset show that a simple ASR-based filtering method can have a big impact in the quality of the generated data, translating to a better performance. Furthermore, despite the good quality of the generated speech data, we also show that synthetic and real speech can still be easily distinguishable when using self-supervised (WavLM) features, an aspect further explored with a CycleGAN to bridge the gap between the two types of speech material.
