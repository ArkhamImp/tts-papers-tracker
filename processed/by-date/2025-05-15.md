- **Abstract**: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content. However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of 1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories, converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency, and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs, underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense mechanisms.

## FlexSpeech: Towards Stable, Controllable and Expressive Text-to-Speech
- **Authors**: Linhan Ma et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2505.05159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05159)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: High-quality speech dialogue datasets are crucial for Speech-LLM development, yet existing acquisition methods face significant limitations. Human recordings incur high costs and privacy concerns, while synthetic approaches often lack conversational authenticity. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{SpeechDialogueFactory}, a production-ready framework for generating natural speech dialogues efficiently. Our solution employs a comprehensive pipeline including metadata generation, dialogue scripting, paralinguistic-enriched utterance simulation, and natural speech synthesis with voice cloning. Additionally, the system provides an interactive UI for detailed sample inspection and a high-throughput batch synthesis mode. Evaluations show that dialogues generated by our system achieve a quality comparable to human recordings while significantly reducing production costs. We release our work as an open-source toolkit, alongside example datasets available in English and Chinese, empowering researchers and developers in Speech-LLM research and development.
