- **Abstract**: This paper introduces a high-quality open-source text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis dataset for Mongolian, a low-resource language spoken by over 10 million people worldwide. The dataset, named MnTTS, consists of about 8 hours of transcribed audio recordings spoken by a 22-year-old professional female Mongolian announcer. It is the first publicly available dataset developed to promote Mongolian TTS applications in both academia and industry. In this paper, we share our experience by describing the dataset development procedures and faced challenges. To demonstrate the reliability of our dataset, we built a powerful non-autoregressive baseline system based on FastSpeech2 model and HiFi-GAN vocoder, and evaluated it using the subjective mean opinion score (MOS) and real time factor (RTF) metrics. Evaluation results show that the powerful baseline system trained on our dataset achieves MOS above 4 and RTF about $3.30\times10^{-1}$, which makes it applicable for practical use. The dataset, training recipe, and pretrained TTS models are freely available \footnote{\label{github}\url{https://github.com/walker-hyf/MnTTS}}.
