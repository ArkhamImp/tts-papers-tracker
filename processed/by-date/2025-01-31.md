- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in personalized speech generation have brought synthetic speech increasingly close to the realism of target speakers' recordings, yet multimodal speaker generation remains on the rise. This paper introduces UniSpeaker, a unified approach for multimodality-driven speaker generation. Specifically, we propose a unified voice aggregator based on KV-Former, applying soft contrastive loss to map diverse voice description modalities into a shared voice space, ensuring that the generated voice aligns more closely with the input descriptions. To evaluate multimodality-driven voice control, we build the first multimodality-based voice control (MVC) benchmark, focusing on voice suitability, voice diversity, and speech quality. UniSpeaker is evaluated across five tasks using the MVC benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that UniSpeaker outperforms previous modality-specific models.
