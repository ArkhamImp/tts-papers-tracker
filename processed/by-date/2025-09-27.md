- **Abstract**: Cross-lingual emotional text-to-speech (TTS) aims to produce speech in one language that captures the emotion of a speaker from another language while maintaining the target voice's timbre. This process of cross-lingual emotional speech synthesis presents a complex challenge, necessitating flexible control over emotion, timbre, and language. However, emotion and timbre are highly entangled in speech signals, making fine-grained control challenging. To address this issue, we propose EMM-TTS, a novel two-stage cross-lingual emotional speech synthesis framework based on perturbed self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. In the first stage, the model explicitly and implicitly encodes prosodic cues to capture emotional expressiveness, while the second stage restores the timbre from perturbed SSL representations. We further investigate the effect of different speaker perturbation strategies-formant shifting and speaker anonymization-on the disentanglement of emotion and timbre. To strengthen speaker preservation and expressive control, we introduce Speaker Consistency Loss (SCL) and Speaker-Emotion Adaptive Layer Normalization (SEALN) modules. Additionally, we find that incorporating explicit acoustic features (e.g., F0, energy, and duration) alongside pretrained latent features improves voice cloning performance. Comprehensive multi-metric evaluations, including both subjective and objective measures, demonstrate that EMM-TTS achieves superior naturalness, emotion transferability, and timbre consistency across languages.

## i-LAVA: Insights on Low Latency Voice-2-Voice Architecture for Agents

- **Abstract**: Fine-grained control over voice impressions (e.g., making a voice brighter or calmer) is a key frontier for creating more controllable text-to-speech. However, this nascent field faces two key challenges. The first is the problem of impression leakage, where the synthesized voice is undesirably influenced by the speaker's reference audio, rather than the separately specified target impression, and the second is the lack of a public, annotated corpus. To mitigate impression leakage, we propose two methods: 1) a training strategy that separately uses an utterance for speaker identity and another utterance of the same speaker for target impression, and 2) a novel reference-free model that generates a speaker embedding solely from the target impression, achieving the benefits of improved robustness against the leakage and the convenience of reference-free generation. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate a significant improvement in controllability. Our best method reduced the mean squared error of 11-dimensional voice impression vectors from 0.61 to 0.41 objectively and from 1.15 to 0.92 subjectively, while maintaining high fidelity. To foster reproducible research, we introduce LibriTTS-VI, the first public voice impression dataset released with clear annotation standards, built upon the LibriTTS-R corpus.
