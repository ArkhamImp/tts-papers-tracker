- **Abstract**: Hidden-Markov-model (HMM) based text-to-speech (HTS) offers flexibility in speaking styles along with fast training and synthesis while being computationally less intense. HTS performs well even in low-resource scenarios. The primary drawback is that the voice quality is poor compared to that of E2E systems. A hybrid approach combining HMM-based feature generation and neural-network-based HiFi-GAN vocoder to improve HTS synthesis quality is proposed. HTS is trained on high-resolution mel-spectrograms instead of conventional mel generalized coefficients (MGC), and the output mel-spectrogram corresponding to the input text is used in a HiFi-GAN vocoder trained on Indic languages, to produce naturalness that is equivalent to that of E2E systems, as evidenced from the DMOS and PC tests.
