- **Abstract**: Rhythmic fluctuations in acoustic energy and accompanying neuronal excitations in cortical oscillations are characteristic of human speech, yet whether a corresponding rhythmicity inheres in the articulatory movements that generate speech remains unclear. The received understanding of speech movements as discrete, goal-oriented actions struggles to make contact with the rhythmicity findings. In this work, we demonstrate that an unintuitive -- but no less principled than the conventional -- representation for discrete movements reveals a pervasive limit cycle organization and unlocks the recovery of previously inaccessible rhythmic structure underlying the motor activity of speech. These results help resolve a time-honored tension between the ubiquity of biological rhythmicity and discreteness in speech, the quintessential human higher function, by revealing a rhythmic organization at the most fundamental level of individual articulatory actions.

- **Abstract**: Communication between deaf users, visually im paired users, and the general hearing population often relies on tools that support only one direction of interaction. To address this limitation, this work presents Sanvaad, a lightweight multimodal accessibility framework designed to support real time, two-way communication. For deaf users, Sanvaad includes an ISL recognition module built on MediaPipe landmarks. MediaPipe is chosen primarily for its efficiency and low computational load, enabling the system to run smoothly on edge devices without requiring dedicated hardware. Spoken input from a phone can also be translated into sign representations through a voice-to-sign component that maps detected speech to predefined phrases and produces corresponding GIFs or alphabet-based visualizations. For visually impaired users, the framework provides a screen free voice interface that integrates multilingual speech recognition, text summarization, and text-to-speech generation. These components work together through a Streamlit-based interface, making the system usable on both desktop and mobile environments. Overall, Sanvaad aims to offer a practical and accessible pathway for inclusive communication by combining lightweight computer vision and speech processing tools within a unified framework.
