- **Abstract**: Neural speech editing enables seamless partial edits to speech utterances, allowing modifications to selected content while preserving the rest of the audio unchanged. This useful technique, however, also poses new risks of deepfakes. To encourage research on detecting such partially edited deepfake speech, we introduce PartialEdit, a deepfake speech dataset curated using advanced neural editing techniques. We explore both detection and localization tasks on PartialEdit. Our experiments reveal that models trained on the existing PartialSpoof dataset fail to detect partially edited speech generated by neural speech editing models. As recent speech editing models almost all involve neural audio codecs, we also provide insights into the artifacts the model learned on detecting these deepfakes. Further information about the PartialEdit dataset and audio samples can be found on the project page: https://yzyouzhang.com/PartialEdit/index.html.

- **Abstract**: With the continuous development of deep learning-based speech conversion and speech synthesis technologies, the cybersecurity problem posed by fake audio has become increasingly serious. Previously proposed models for defending against fake audio have attained remarkable performance. However, they all fall short in modeling the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the models themselves. Based on this, we put forward a plausible fake audio detection approach based on the Dirichlet distribution with the aim of enhancing the reliability of fake audio detection. Specifically, we first generate evidence through a neural network. Uncertainty is then modeled using the Dirichlet distribution. By modeling the belief distribution with the parameters of the Dirichlet distribution, an estimate of uncertainty can be obtained for each decision. Finally, the predicted probabilities and corresponding uncertainty estimates are combined to form the final opinion. On the ASVspoof series dataset (i.e., ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 2021 LA, and DF), we conduct a number of comparison experiments to verify the excellent performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, robustness, and trustworthiness.

## PartialEdit: Identifying Partial Deepfakes in the Era of Neural Speech Editing
- **Authors**: You Zhang et.al.

- **Tags**: editing
- **Abstract**: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems. Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches, allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for unknown words.

## CapSpeech: Enabling Downstream Applications in Style-Captioned Text-to-Speech

- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have increased demand for personalized audio synthesis. Zero-shot voice cloning, a specialized TTS task, aims to synthesize a target speaker's voice using only a single audio sample and arbitrary text, without prior exposure to the speaker during training. This process employs pattern recognition techniques to analyze and replicate the speaker's unique vocal features. Despite progress, challenges remain in adapting to the vocal style of unseen speakers, highlighting difficulties in generalizing TTS systems to handle diverse voices while maintaining naturalness, expressiveness, and speaker fidelity. To address the challenges of unseen speaker style adaptation, we propose DS-TTS, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the synthesis of diverse, previously unheard voices. Central to our method is a Dual-Style Encoding Network (DuSEN), where two distinct style encoders capture complementary aspects of a speaker's vocal identity. These speaker-specific style vectors are seamlessly integrated into the Dynamic Generator Network (DyGN) via a Style Gating-Film (SGF) mechanism, enabling more accurate and expressive reproduction of unseen speakers' unique vocal characteristics. In addition, we introduce a Dynamic Generator Network to tackle synthesis issues that arise with varying sentence lengths. By dynamically adapting to the length of the input, this component ensures robust performance across diverse text inputs and speaker styles, significantly improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen speakers in a more natural and expressive manner. Experimental evaluations on the VCTK dataset suggest that DS-TTS demonstrates superior overall performance in voice cloning tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art models, showing notable improvements in both word error rate and speaker similarity.

## Prompt-Unseen-Emotion: Zero-shot Expressive Speech Synthesis with Prompt-LLM Contextual Knowledge for Mixed Emotions
- **Authors**: Xiaoxue Gao et.al.

- **Tags**: zero-shot, expressive, llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for manual optimization. Audio examples are available on our demo page (https://ntt-hilab-gensp.github.io/is2025voiceimpression/).

- **Abstract**: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations, and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners. While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.

## SingaKids: A Multilingual Multimodal Dialogic Tutor for Language Learning

- **Abstract**: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.

- **Abstract**: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based outputs limits their ability to generate natural speech responses directly, hindering seamless audio interactions. To address this, we introduce Step-Audio-AQAA, a fully end-to-end LALM designed for Audio Query-Audio Answer (AQAA) tasks. The model integrates a dual-codebook audio tokenizer for linguistic and semantic feature extraction, a 130-billion-parameter backbone LLM and a neural vocoder for high-fidelity speech synthesis. Our post-training approach employs interleaved token-output of text and audio to enhance semantic coherence and combines Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with model merge to improve performance. Evaluations on the StepEval-Audio-360 benchmark demonstrate that Step-Audio-AQAA excels especially in speech control, outperforming the state-of-art LALMs in key areas. This work contributes a promising solution for end-to-end LALMs and highlights the critical role of token-based vocoder in enhancing overall performance for AQAA tasks.
