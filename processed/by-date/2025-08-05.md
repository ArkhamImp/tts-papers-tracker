- **Abstract**: The rapid development of audio-driven talking head generators and advanced Text-To-Speech (TTS) models has led to more sophisticated temporal deepfakes. These advances highlight the need for robust methods capable of detecting and localizing deepfakes, even under novel, unseen attack scenarios. Current state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and struggle to generalize to novel manipulation techniques. To address these challenges, we propose multimodal approaches for the AV-Deepfake1M 2025 challenge. For the visual modality, we leverage handcrafted features to improve interpretability and adaptability. For the audio modality, we adapt a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone coupled with graph attention networks to capture rich audio representations, improving detection robustness. Our approach strikes a balance between performance and real-world deployment, focusing on resilience and potential interpretability. On the AV-Deepfake1M++ dataset, our multimodal system achieves AUC of 92.78% for deepfake classification task and IoU of 0.3536 for temporal localization using only the audio modality.

## MiSTR: Multi-Modal iEEG-to-Speech Synthesis with Transformer-Based Prosody Prediction and Neural Phase Reconstruction
- **Authors**: Mohammed Salah Al-Radhi et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2508.03166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03166)
- **Tags**: expressive, llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time deepfake detection research. We investigate whether bidirectional Mamba can serve as a competitive alternative to Self-Attention in detecting synthetic speech. Our solution, Fake-Mamba, integrates an XLSR front-end with bidirectional Mamba to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and PN-BiMamba. Leveraging XLSR's rich linguistic representations, PN-BiMamba can effectively capture the subtle cues of synthetic speech. Evaluated on ASVspoof 21 LA, 21 DF, and In-The-Wild benchmarks, Fake-Mamba achieves 0.97%, 1.74%, and 5.85% EER, respectively, representing substantial relative gains over SOTA models XLSR-Conformer and XLSR-Mamba. The framework maintains real-time inference across utterance lengths, demonstrating strong generalization and practical viability. The code is available at https://github.com/xuanxixi/Fake-Mamba.

## Fine-Tuning Text-to-Speech Diffusion Models Using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
- **Authors**: Jingyi Chen et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2508.03123](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03123)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing the realism of vocoder-generated singing voice audio by mitigating the distinguishable disparities between synthetic and real-life recordings, particularly in high-frequency spectrogram components. Our proposed approach combines two innovations: an explicit linear spectrogram estimation step using denoising diffusion process with DiT-based neural network architecture optimized for time-frequency data, and a redesigned vocoder based on Vocos specialized in handling large linear spectrograms with increased frequency bins. This integrated method can produce audio with high-fidelity spectrograms that are challenging for both human listeners and machine classifiers to differentiate from authentic recordings. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our streamlined approach maintains high audio quality while achieving this realism. This work presents a substantial advancement in overcoming the limitations of current vocoding techniques, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks on fake spectrogram detection.
