## Prosody-Guided Harmonic Attention for Phase-Coherent Neural Vocoding in the Complex Spectrum

- **Tags**: expressive
- **Abstract**: Neural vocoders are central to speech synthesis; despite their success, most still suffer from limited prosody modeling and inaccurate phase reconstruction. We propose a vocoder that introduces prosody-guided harmonic attention to enhance voiced segment encoding and directly predicts complex spectral components for waveform synthesis via inverse STFT. Unlike mel-spectrogram-based approaches, our design jointly models magnitude and phase, ensuring phase coherence and improved pitch fidelity. To further align with perceptual quality, we adopt a multi-objective training strategy that integrates adversarial, spectral, and phase-aware losses. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent gains over HiFi-GAN and AutoVocoder: F0 RMSE reduced by 22 percent, voiced/unvoiced error lowered by 18 percent, and MOS scores improved by 0.15. These results show that prosody-guided attention combined with direct complex spectrum modeling yields more natural, pitch-accurate, and robust synthetic speech, setting a strong foundation for expressive neural vocoding.

## Synthetic Singers: A Review of Deep-Learning-based Singing Voice Synthesis Approaches
- **Authors**: Changhao Pan et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.13910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13910)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in singing voice synthesis (SVS) have attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models and novel generative paradigms, producing controllable, high-fidelity singing voices has become an attainable goal. Yet the field still lacks a comprehensive survey that systematically analyzes deep-learning-based singing voice synthesis systems and their enabling technologies. To address the aforementioned issue, this survey first categorizes existing systems by task type and then organizes current architectures into two major paradigms: cascaded and end-to-end approaches. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of core technologies, covering singing modeling and control techniques. Finally, we review relevant datasets, annotation tools, and evaluation benchmarks that support training and assessment. In appendix, we introduce training strategies and further discussion of SVS. This survey provides an up-to-date review of the literature on SVS models, which would be a useful reference for both researchers and engineers.

## Habibi: Laying the Open-Source Foundation of Unified-Dialectal Arabic Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Yushen Chen et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.13802](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13802)
- **Tags**: multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: A notable gap persists in speech synthesis research and development for Arabic dialects, particularly from a unified modeling perspective. Despite its high practical value, the inherent linguistic complexity of Arabic dialects, further compounded by a lack of standardized data, benchmarks, and evaluation guidelines, steers researchers toward safer ground. To bridge this divide, we present Habibi, a suite of specialized and unified text-to-speech models that harnesses existing open-source ASR corpora to support a wide range of high- to low-resource Arabic dialects through linguistically-informed curriculum learning. Our approach outperforms the leading commercial service in generation quality, while maintaining extensibility through effective in-context learning, without requiring text diacritization. We are committed to open-sourcing the model, along with creating the first systematic benchmark for multi-dialect Arabic speech synthesis. Furthermore, by identifying the key challenges in and establishing evaluation standards for the process, we aim to provide a solid groundwork for subsequent research.

## HoverAI: An Embodied Aerial Agent for Natural Human-Drone Interaction
- **Authors**: Yuhua Jin et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.13801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13801)
- **Tags**: other
- **Abstract**: Drones operating in human-occupied spaces suffer from insufficient communication mechanisms that create uncertainty about their intentions. We present HoverAI, an embodied aerial agent that integrates drone mobility, infrastructure-independent visual projection, and real-time conversational AI into a unified platform. Equipped with a MEMS laser projector, onboard semi-rigid screen, and RGB camera, HoverAI perceives users through vision and voice, responding via lip-synced avatars that adapt appearance to user demographics. The system employs a multimodal pipeline combining VAD, ASR (Whisper), LLM-based intent classification, RAG for dialogue, face analysis for personalization, and voice synthesis (XTTS v2). Evaluation demonstrates high accuracy in command recognition (F1: 0.90), demographic estimation (gender F1: 0.89, age MAE: 5.14 years), and speech transcription (WER: 0.181). By uniting aerial robotics with adaptive conversational AI and self-contained visual output, HoverAI introduces a new class of spatially-aware, socially responsive embodied agents for applications in guidance, assistance, and human-centered interaction.
