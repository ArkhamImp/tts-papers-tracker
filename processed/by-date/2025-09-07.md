- **Abstract**: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

## Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph Modeling for Conversational Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover, they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable, natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new 12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers. Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness with context-consistent prosody.
