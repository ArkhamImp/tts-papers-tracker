- **Abstract**: The control of perceptual voice qualities in a text-to-speech (TTS) system is of interest for applications where unmanipu- lated and manipulated speech probes can serve to illustrate pho- netic concepts that are otherwise difficult to grasp. Here, we show that a TTS system, that is augmented with a global speaker attribute manipulation block based on normalizing flows1 , is capable of correctly manipulating the non-persistent, localized quality of creaky voice, thus avoiding the necessity of a, typi- cally unreliable, frame-wise creak predictor. Subjective listen- ing tests confirm successful creak manipulation at a slightly re- duced MOS score compared to the original recording.

- **Abstract**: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.
