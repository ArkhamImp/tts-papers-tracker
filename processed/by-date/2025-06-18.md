- **Abstract**: Foreign accent conversion (FAC) in speech processing remains a challenging task. Building on the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks, this study investigates the adaptation of LLM-based techniques for FAC, which we term SpeechAccentLLM. At the core of this framework, we introduce SpeechCodeVAE, the first model to integrate connectionist temporal classification (CTC) directly into codebook discretization for speech content tokenization. This novel architecture generates tokens with a unique "locality" property, as validated by experiments demonstrating optimal trade-offs among content faithfulness, temporal coherence, and structural recoverability. Then, to address data scarcity for the FAC module, we adopted a multitask learning strategy that jointly trains the FAC and TTS modules. Beyond mitigating data limitations, this approach yielded accelerated convergence and superior speech quality compared to standalone FAC training. Moreover, leveraging the salient properties of our discrete speech representations, we introduce SpeechRestorer, a postprocessing architecture designed to refine LLM-generated outputs. This module effectively mitigates stochastic errors prevalent in LLM inference pipelines while enhancing prosodic continuity, as validated by ablation experiments.

- **Abstract**: Controllable speech synthesis aims to control the style of generated speech using reference input, which can be of various modalities. Existing face-based methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities, their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.

## EmojiVoice: Towards long-term controllable expressivity in robot speech

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in speech synthesis have introduced unprecedented challenges in maintaining voice authenticity, particularly concerning public figures who are frequent targets of impersonation attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for collecting, curating, and generating synthetic speech data for political figures and a detailed analysis of challenges encountered. We introduce a systematic approach incorporating an automated pipeline for collecting high-quality bonafide speech samples, featuring transcription-based segmentation that significantly improves synthetic speech quality. We experimented with various synthesis approaches; from single-speaker to zero-shot synthesis, and documented the evolution of our methodology. The resulting dataset comprises bonafide and synthetic speech samples from ten public figures, demonstrating superior quality with a NISQA-TTS naturalness score of 3.69 and the highest human misclassification rate of 61.9\%.

## An accurate and revised version of optical character recognition-based speech synthesis using LabVIEW
- **Authors**: Prateek Mehta et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2506.15029](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15029)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.
