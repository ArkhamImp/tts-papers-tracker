- **Abstract**: Autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as powerful solutions for zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, capable of generating natural speech from a few seconds of audio prompts. However, conventional AR-based TTS systems relying on discrete audio tokens face the challenge of lossy compression during tokenization, requiring longer discrete token sequences to capture the same information as continuous ones, which adds inference latency and complicates AR modeling. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Continuous Latent Autoregressive model (CLEAR), a unified zero-shot TTS framework that directly models continuous audio representations. More specifically, CLEAR introduces an enhanced variational autoencoder with shortcut connections, which achieves a high compression ratio to map waveforms into compact continuous latents. A lightweight MLP-based rectified flow head that operates independently for each hidden state is presented to model the continuous latent probability distribution, and trained jointly with the AR model within a single-stage framework. Experiments show that the proposed zero-shot CLEAR TTS can synthesize high-quality speech with low latency. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTS models, CLEAR delivers competitive performance in robustness, speaker similarity and naturalness, while offering a lower real-time factor (RTF). In particular, CLEAR achieves SOTA results on the LibriSpeech test-clean dataset, with a word error rate of 1.88\% and an RTF of 0.29. Moreover, CLEAR facilitates streaming speech synthesis with a first-frame delay of 96ms, while maintaining high-quality speech synthesis.

- **Abstract**: Early screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through speech presents a promising non-invasive approach. However, challenges such as limited data and the lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to enhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS) augmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model generalization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to obtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that enriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE mechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature fusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS achieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\%, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS augmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings highlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios, particularly in data-limited settings.
