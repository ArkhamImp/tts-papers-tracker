- **Abstract**: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) is a key task in the user-agent interaction area, aiming to generate more expressive and empathetic speech for users. However, it is well-known that "listening" and "eye contact" play crucial roles in conveying emotions during real-world interpersonal communication. Existing CSS research is limited to perceiving only text and speech within the dialogue context, which restricts its effectiveness. Moreover, speech-only responses further constrain the interactive experience. To address these limitations, we introduce a Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis (CSVS) task as an extension of traditional CSS. By leveraging multimodal dialogue context, it provides users with coherent audiovisual responses. To this end, we develop a CSVS system named UniTalker, which is a unified model that seamlessly integrates multimodal perception and multimodal rendering capabilities. Specifically, it leverages a large-scale language model to comprehensively understand multimodal cues in the dialogue context, including speaker, text, speech, and the talking-face animations. After that, it employs multi-task sequence prediction to first infer the target utterance's emotion and then generate empathetic speech and natural talking-face animations. To ensure that the generated speech-visual content remains consistent in terms of emotion, content, and duration, we introduce three key optimizations: 1) Designing a specialized neural landmark codec to tokenize and reconstruct facial expression sequences. 2) Proposing a bimodal speech-visual hard alignment decoding strategy. 3) Applying emotion-guided rendering during the generation stage. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our model synthesizes more empathetic speech and provides users with more natural and emotionally consistent talking-face animations.

## QAMRO: Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization for Human-aligned Assessment of Audio Generation Systems

- **Abstract**: We propose UtterTune, a lightweight adaptation method that fine-tunes a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system based on a large language model (LLM) architecture, designed to enhance the controllability of pronunciation in a target language while preserving performance in others. While LLM architectures have enabled TTS models to achieve remarkable naturalness, accurately modeling grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) mapping and prosody remains challenging, especially when the model omits an explicit G2P module and directly processes minimally encoded text (e.g., byte-pair encoding). UtterTune leverages low-rank adaptation to enable the control of segmental pronunciation and pitch accent at the phoneme level for Japanese speech, the target language in this paper, while maintaining naturalness and speaker similarity in a zero-shot setting. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm its effectiveness.

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in real-time, resource-limited settings.

## XEmoRAG: Cross-Lingual Emotion Transfer with Controllable Intensity Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **Abstract**: Extending pre-trained text Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.
