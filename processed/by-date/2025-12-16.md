## Adapting Speech Language Model to Singing Voice Synthesis
- **Authors**: Yiwen Zhao et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2512.14657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14657)
- **Tags**: multilingual, llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: This work proposes GLM-TTS, a production-level TTS system designed for efficiency, controllability, and high-fidelity speech generation. GLM-TTS follows a two-stage architecture, consisting of a text-to-token autoregressive model and a token-to-waveform diffusion model. With only 100k hours of training data, GLM-TTS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-source benchmarks. To meet production requirements, GLM-TTS improves speech quality through an optimized speech tokenizer with fundamental frequency constraints and a GRPO-based multi-reward reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes pronunciation, speaker similarity, and expressive prosody. In parallel, the system enables efficient and controllable deployment via parameter-efficient LoRA-based voice customization and a hybrid phoneme-text input scheme that provides precise pronunciation control. Our code is available at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-TTS. Real-time speech synthesis demos are provided via Z.ai (audio.z.ai), the Zhipu Qingyan app/web (chatglm.cn).

## Robust Training of Singing Voice Synthesis Using Prior and Posterior Uncertainty

- **Abstract**: In prior work, we introduced IndexTTS 2, a zero-shot neural text-to-speech foundation model comprising two core components: a transformer-based Text-to-Semantic (T2S) module and a non-autoregressive Semantic-to-Mel (S2M) module, which together enable faithful emotion replication and establish the first autoregressive duration-controllable generative paradigm. Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.

## GLM-TTS Technical Report

- **Abstract**: Audiobook interpretations are attracting increasing attention, as they provide accessible and in-depth analyses of books that offer readers practical insights and intellectual inspiration. However, their manual creation process remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose AI4Reading, a multi-agent collaboration system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and speech synthesis technology to generate podcast, like audiobook interpretations. The system is designed to meet three key objectives: accurate content preservation, enhanced comprehensibility, and a logical narrative structure. To achieve these goals, we develop a framework composed of 11 specialized agents,including topic analysts, case analysts, editors, a narrator, and proofreaders that work in concert to explore themes, extract real world cases, refine content organization, and synthesize natural spoken language. By comparing expert interpretations with our system's output, the results show that although AI4Reading still has a gap in speech generation quality, the generated interpretative scripts are simpler and more accurate.
