- **Abstract**: Recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) have enabled natural speech synthesis, but fine-grained, time-varying emotion control remains challenging. Existing methods often allow only utterance-level control and require full model fine-tuning with a large emotion speech dataset, which can degrade performance. Inspired by adding conditional control to the existing model in ControlNet (Zhang et al, 2023), we propose the first ControlNet-based approach for controllable flow-matching TTS (TTS-CtrlNet), which freezes the original model and introduces a trainable copy of it to process additional conditions. We show that TTS-CtrlNet can boost the pretrained large TTS model by adding intuitive, scalable, and time-varying emotion control while inheriting the ability of the original model (e.g., zero-shot voice cloning &amp; naturalness). Furthermore, we provide practical recipes for adding emotion control: 1) optimal architecture design choice with block analysis, 2) emotion-specific flow step, and 3) flexible control scale. Experiments show that ours can effectively add an emotion controller to existing TTS, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with emotion similarity scores: Emo-SIM and Aro-Val SIM.

## Learning Japanese with Jouzu: Interaction Outcomes with Stylized Dialogue Fictional Agents

- **Abstract**: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics, the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs. In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on multimodal signals - text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to support controllable gesture generation across affective states. To visualize results, we implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic voices - marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware digital humans.
