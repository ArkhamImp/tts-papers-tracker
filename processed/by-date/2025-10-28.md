- **Abstract**: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

- **Abstract**: Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution (SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML representation with appropriate "lang" or "voice" spans and synthesizes the utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models, SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility, naturalness, and user preference.

- **Abstract**: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However, when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced. Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging. The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking, expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc. Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be necessary.

## SoulX-Podcast: Towards Realistic Long-form Podcasts with Dialectal and Paralinguistic Diversity

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), driven by language models, diffusion models and masked generation, have achieved impressive naturalness in speech synthesis. Nevertheless, stability and fidelity remain key challenges, manifesting as mispronunciations, audible noise, and quality degradation. To address these issues, we introduce Vox-Evaluator, a multi-level evaluator designed to guide the correction of erroneous speech segments and preference alignment for TTS systems. It is capable of identifying the temporal boundaries of erroneous segments and providing a holistic quality assessment of the generated speech. Specifically, to refine erroneous segments and enhance the robustness of the zero-shot TTS model, we propose to automatically identify acoustic errors with the evaluator, mask the erroneous segments, and finally regenerate speech conditioning on the correct portions. In addition, the fine-gained information obtained from Vox-Evaluator can guide the preference alignment for TTS model, thereby reducing the bad cases in speech synthesis. Due to the lack of suitable training datasets for the Vox-Evaluator, we also constructed a synthesized text-speech dataset annotated with fine-grained pronunciation errors or audio quality issues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Vox-Evaluator in enhancing the stability and fidelity of TTS systems through the speech correction mechanism and preference optimization. The demos are shown.
