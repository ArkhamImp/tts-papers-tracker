- **Abstract**: SpeechBrain is an open-source Conversational AI toolkit based on PyTorch, focused particularly on speech processing tasks such as speech recognition, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, text-to-speech, and much more. It promotes transparency and replicability by releasing both the pre-trained models and the complete "recipes" of code and algorithms required for training them. This paper presents SpeechBrain 1.0, a significant milestone in the evolution of the toolkit, which now has over 200 recipes for speech, audio, and language processing tasks, and more than 100 models available on Hugging Face. SpeechBrain 1.0 introduces new technologies to support diverse learning modalities, Large Language Model (LLM) integration, and advanced decoding strategies, along with novel models, tasks, and modalities. It also includes a new benchmark repository, offering researchers a unified platform for evaluating models across diverse tasks.

- **Abstract**: Speaker adaptation, which involves cloning voices from unseen speakers in the Text-to-Speech task, has garnered significant interest due to its numerous applications in multi-media fields. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle with inadequate speaker representation accuracy and overfitting, particularly in limited reference speeches scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an Agile Speaker Representation Reinforcement Learning strategy to enhance speaker similarity in speaker adaptation tasks. ASRRL is the first work to apply reinforcement learning to improve the modeling accuracy of speaker embeddings in speaker adaptation, addressing the challenge of decoupling voice content and timbre. Our approach introduces two action strategies tailored to different reference speeches scenarios. In the single-sentence scenario, a knowledge-oriented optimal routine searching RL method is employed to expedite the exploration and retrieval of refinement information on the fringe of speaker representations. In the few-sentence scenario, we utilize a dynamic RL method to adaptively fuse reference speeches, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of speaker modeling. To achieve optimal results in the target domain, a multi-scale fusion scoring mechanism based reward model that evaluates speaker similarity, speech quality, and intelligibility across three dimensions is proposed, ensuring that improvements in speaker similarity do not compromise speech quality or intelligibility. The experimental results on the LibriTTS and VCTK datasets within mainstream TTS frameworks demonstrate the extensibility and generalization capabilities of the proposed ASRRL method. The results indicate that the ASRRL method significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches, achieving higher speaker similarity and better overall speech quality with limited reference speeches.
