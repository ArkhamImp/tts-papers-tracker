- **Abstract**: Flow matching offers a robust and stable approach to training diffusion models. However, directly applying flow matching to neural vocoders can result in subpar audio quality. In this work, we present WaveFM, a reparameterized flow matching model for mel-spectrogram conditioned speech synthesis, designed to enhance both sample quality and generation speed for diffusion vocoders. Since mel-spectrograms represent the energy distribution of waveforms, WaveFM adopts a mel-conditioned prior distribution instead of a standard Gaussian prior to minimize unnecessary transportation costs during synthesis. Moreover, while most diffusion vocoders rely on a single loss function, we argue that incorporating auxiliary losses, including a refined multi-resolution STFT loss, can further improve audio quality. To speed up inference without degrading sample quality significantly, we introduce a tailored consistency distillation method for WaveFM. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in both quality and efficiency compared to previous diffusion vocoders, while enabling waveform generation in a single inference step.

- **Abstract**: Speech to speech translation (S2ST) is a transformative technology that bridges global communication gaps, enabling real time multilingual interactions in diplomacy, tourism, and international trade. Our review examines the evolution of S2ST, comparing traditional cascade models which rely on automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text to speech (TTS) components with newer end to end and direct speech translation (DST) models that bypass intermediate text representations. While cascade models offer modularity and optimized components, they suffer from error propagation, increased latency, and loss of prosody. In contrast, direct S2ST models retain speaker identity, reduce latency, and improve translation naturalness by preserving vocal characteristics and prosody. However, they remain limited by data sparsity, high computational costs, and generalization challenges for low-resource languages. The current work critically evaluates these approaches, their tradeoffs, and future directions for improving real time multilingual communication.

- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in neural audio codecs have enabled the use of tokenized audio representations in various audio generation tasks, such as text-to-speech, text-to-audio, and text-to-music generation. Leveraging this approach, we propose TokenSynth, a novel neural synthesizer that utilizes a decoder-only transformer to generate desired audio tokens from MIDI tokens and CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) embedding, which has timbre-related information. Our model is capable of performing instrument cloning, text-to-instrument synthesis, and text-guided timbre manipulation without any fine-tuning. This flexibility enables diverse sound design and intuitive timbre control. We evaluated the quality of the synthesized audio, the timbral similarity between synthesized and target audio/text, and synthesis accuracy (i.e., how accurately it follows the input MIDI) using objective measures. TokenSynth demonstrates the potential of leveraging advanced neural audio codecs and transformers to create powerful and versatile neural synthesizers.
