## A2TTS: TTS for Low Resource Indian Languages
- **Authors**: Ayush Singh Bhadoriya et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2507.15272](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15272)
- **Tags**: multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) synthesizes speech in a target speaker's voice while preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. However, timbre leakage-where source speaker traits persist-remains a challenge, especially in neural codec and LLM-based VC, where quantized representations entangle speaker identity with content. We introduce SemAlignVC, an architecture designed to prevent timbre leakage using SemAlign, a novel method that aligns text and audio representations to ensure speaker-independent semantic encoding. This disentangled representation conditions an autoregressive transformer for high-fidelity conversion without explicit speaker embeddings. Experiments show SemAlignVC significantly reduces timbre leakage, outperforming baselines in speaker timbre similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness, making it a robust, privacy-preserving, and generalizable VC solution.

## EchoVoices: Preserving Generational Voices and Memories for Seniors and Children
- **Authors**: Haiying Xu et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2507.15221](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15221)
- **Tags**: other
- **Abstract**: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations (NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso, using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics, including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive TTS research. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepvk/NonverbalTTS.
