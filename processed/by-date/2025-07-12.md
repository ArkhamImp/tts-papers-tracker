- **Abstract**: Farmers in developing regions like Karnataka, India, face a dual challenge: navigating extreme market and climate volatility while being excluded from the digital revolution due to literacy barriers. This paper presents a novel decision support system that addresses both challenges through a unique synthesis of machine learning and human-computer interaction. We propose a hybrid recommendation engine that integrates two predictive models: a Random Forest classifier to assess agronomic suitability based on soil, climate, and real-time weather data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast market prices for agronomically viable crops. This integrated approach shifts the paradigm from "what can grow?" to "what is most profitable to grow?", providing a significant advantage in mitigating economic risk. The system is delivered through an end-to-end, voice-based interface in the local Kannada language, leveraging fine-tuned speech recognition and high-fidelity speech synthesis models to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users. Our results show that the Random Forest model achieves 98.5% accuracy in suitability prediction, while the LSTM model forecasts harvest-time prices with a low margin of error. By providing data-driven, economically optimized recommendations through an inclusive interface, this work offers a scalable and impactful solution to enhance the financial resilience of marginalized farming communities.

## Voice Conversion for Lombard Speaking Style with Implicit and Explicit Acoustic Feature Conditioning

- **Abstract**: We explore Jouzu, a Japanese language learning application that integrates large language models with anime-inspired conversational agents. Designed to address challenges learners face in practicing natural and expressive dialogue, Jouzu combines stylized character personas with expressive text-to-speech to create engaging conversational scenarios. We conducted a two-week in-the-wild deployment with 52 Japanese learners to examine how such stylized agents influence engagement and learner experience. Our findings show that participants interacted frequently and creatively, with advanced learners demonstrating greater use of expressive forms. Participants reported that the anime-inspired style made practice more enjoyable and encouraged experimenting with different registers. We discuss how stylization shapes willingness to engage, the role of affect in sustaining practice, and design opportunities for culturally grounded conversational AI in computer-assisted language learning (CALL). By framing our findings as an exploration of design and engagement, we highlight opportunities for generalization beyond Japanese contexts and contribute to international HCI scholarship.

## ClaritySpeech: Dementia Obfuscation in Speech

- **Abstract**: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing, privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices. To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen. Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.
