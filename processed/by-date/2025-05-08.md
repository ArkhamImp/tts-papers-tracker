- **Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis through discrete tokenization paradigms, current architectures exhibit fundamental tensions between three critical dimensions: 1) irreversible loss of acoustic characteristics caused by quantization of speech prompts; 2) stringent dependence on precisely aligned prompt speech-text pairs that limit real-world deployment; and 3) catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's native text comprehension during optimization for speech token generation. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-n layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge. Moreover, multi-token prediction is introduced to support real-time streaming TTS synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOAT-TTS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art TTS models while validating the efficacy of synthesized dialect speech data.

- **Abstract**: Recent works have shown that modelling raw waveform directly from text in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion produces more natural-sounding speech than traditional neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on a cascade or two-stage approach. However, current E2E state-of-the-art models are computationally complex and memory-consuming, making them unsuitable for real-time offline on-device applications in low-resource scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Lightweight E2E-TTS (LE2E) model that generates high-quality speech requiring minimal computational resources. We evaluate the proposed model on the LJSpeech dataset and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being up to $90\%$ smaller in terms of model parameters and $10\times$ faster in real-time-factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed E2E training paradigm achieves better quality compared to an equivalent architecture trained in a two-stage approach. Our results suggest that LE2E is a promising approach for developing real-time, high quality, low-resource TTS applications for on-device applications.
