- **Abstract**: Controlling speaking style in text-to-speech (TTS) systems has become a growing focus in both academia and industry. While many existing approaches rely on reference audio to guide style generation, such methods are often impractical due to privacy concerns and limited accessibility. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to control speaking style through natural language prompts; however, their high computational cost, lack of interpretability, and sensitivity to prompt phrasing limit their applicability in real-time and resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose ParaStyleTTS, a lightweight and interpretable TTS framework that enables expressive style control from text prompts alone. ParaStyleTTS features a novel two-level style adaptation architecture that separates prosodic and paralinguistic speech style modeling. It allows fine-grained and robust control over factors such as emotion, gender, and age. Unlike LLM-based methods, ParaStyleTTS maintains consistent style realization across varied prompt formulations and is well-suited for real-world applications, including on-device and low-resource deployment. Experimental results show that ParaStyleTTS generates high-quality speech with performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based systems while being 30x faster, using 8x fewer parameters, and requiring 2.5x less CUDA memory. Moreover, ParaStyleTTS exhibits superior robustness and controllability over paralinguistic speaking styles, providing a practical and efficient solution for style-controllable text-to-speech generation.

- **Abstract**: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

- **Abstract**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated high performance in image classification tasks by effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods often suffer from poor calibration, with models yielding overconfident predictions that misrepresent actual prediction likelihoods. Recently, neural networks trained with {\tt mixup} that linearly interpolates random examples from the training set have shown better calibration in supervised settings. However, calibration of neural models remains under-explored in semi-supervised settings. Although effective in supervised model calibration, random mixup of pseudolabels in SSL presents challenges due to the overconfidence and unreliability of pseudolabels. In this work, we introduce CalibrateMix, a targeted mixup-based approach that aims to improve the calibration of SSL models while maintaining or even improving their classification accuracy. Our method leverages training dynamics of labeled and unlabeled samples to identify ``easy-to-learn'' and ``hard-to-learn'' samples, which in turn are utilized in a targeted mixup of easy and hard samples. Experimental results across several benchmark image datasets show that our method achieves lower expected calibration error (ECE) and superior accuracy compared to existing SSL approaches.

## DenseAnnotate: Enabling Scalable Dense Caption Collection for Images and 3D Scenes via Spoken Descriptions

- **Abstract**: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion, speaking style, and paralinguistics alongside robust zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. Our core innovation lies in leveraging only large-margin synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.
