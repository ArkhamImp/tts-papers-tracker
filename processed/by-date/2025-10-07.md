- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning (SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for advances in synthetic speech detection.

- **Abstract**: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce Paper2Video, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech synthesis, but typically require multi-step sampling, resulting in low inference efficiency. Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation. However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially reducing the model's training cost and complexity.

- **Abstract**: Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.

## Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation (SAFE) Challenge

- **Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel speech enhancement (SE) approach based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), termed Guided diffusion for speech enhancement (GDiffuSE). In contrast to conventional methods that directly map noisy speech to clean speech, our method employs a lightweight helper model to estimate the noise distribution, which is then incorporated into the diffusion denoising process via a guidance mechanism. This design improves robustness by enabling seamless adaptation to unseen noise types and by leveraging large-scale DDPMs originally trained for speech generation in the context of SE. We evaluate our approach on noisy signals obtained by adding noise samples from the BBC sound effects database to LibriSpeech utterances, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines under mismatched noise conditions. Examples are available at our project webpage.
