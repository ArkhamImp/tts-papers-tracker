- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) models have been driven by the integration of large language models (LLMs), enhancing semantic comprehension and improving speech naturalness. However, existing LLM-based TTS models often lack open-source training code and efficient inference acceleration frameworks, limiting their accessibility and adaptability. Additionally, there is no publicly available TTS model specifically optimized for podcast scenarios, which are in high demand for voice interaction applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Muyan-TTS, an open-source trainable TTS model designed for podcast applications within a $50,000 budget. Our model is pre-trained on over 100,000 hours of podcast audio data, enabling zero-shot TTS synthesis with high-quality voice generation. Furthermore, Muyan-TTS supports speaker adaptation with dozens of minutes of target speech, making it highly customizable for individual voices. In addition to open-sourcing the model, we provide a comprehensive data collection and processing pipeline, a full training procedure, and an optimized inference framework that accelerates LLM-based TTS synthesis. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/MYZY-AI/Muyan-TTS.
