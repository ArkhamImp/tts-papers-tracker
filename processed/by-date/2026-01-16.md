## F-Actor: Controllable Conversational Behaviour in Full-Duplex Models

- **Abstract**: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

## FlashLabs Chroma 1.0: A Real-Time End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Model with Personalized Voice Cloning
- **Authors**: Tanyu Chen et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.11141](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11141)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, streaming
- **Abstract**: Recent end-to-end spoken dialogue systems leverage speech tokenizers and neural audio codecs to enable LLMs to operate directly on discrete speech representations. However, these models often exhibit limited speaker identity preservation, hindering personalized voice interaction. In this work, we present Chroma 1.0, the first open-source, real-time, end-to-end spoken dialogue model that achieves both low-latency interaction and high-fidelity personalized voice cloning. Chroma achieves sub-second end-to-end latency through an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2) that supports streaming generation, while maintaining high-quality personalized voice synthesis across multi-turn conversations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chroma achieves a 10.96% relative improvement in speaker similarity over the human baseline, with a Real-Time Factor (RTF) of 0.43, while maintaining strong reasoning and dialogue capabilities. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/FlashLabs-AI-Corp/FlashLabs-Chroma and https://huggingface.co/FlashLabs/Chroma-4B .

## WenetSpeech-Wu: Datasets, Benchmarks, and Models for a Unified Chinese Wu Dialect Speech Processing Ecosystem
- **Authors**: Chengyou Wang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2601.11027](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11027)
- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: Speech processing for low-resource dialects remains a fundamental challenge in developing inclusive and robust speech technologies. Despite its linguistic significance and large speaker population, the Wu dialect of Chinese has long been hindered by the lack of large-scale speech data, standardized evaluation benchmarks, and publicly available models. In this work, we present WenetSpeech-Wu, the first large-scale, multi-dimensionally annotated open-source speech corpus for the Wu dialect, comprising approximately 8,000 hours of diverse speech data. Building upon this dataset, we introduce WenetSpeech-Wu-Bench, the first standardized and publicly accessible benchmark for systematic evaluation of Wu dialect speech processing, covering automatic speech recognition (ASR), Wu-to-Mandarin translation, speaker attribute prediction, speech emotion recognition, text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and instruction-following TTS (instruct TTS). Furthermore, we release a suite of strong open-source models trained on WenetSpeech-Wu, establishing competitive performance across multiple tasks and empirically validating the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Together, these contributions lay the foundation for a comprehensive Wu dialect speech processing ecosystem, and we open-source proposed datasets, benchmarks, and models to support future research on dialectal speech intelligence.
