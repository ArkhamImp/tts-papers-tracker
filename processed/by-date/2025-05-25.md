- **Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved text-to-speech (TTS) systems, enhancing control over speech style, naturalness, and emotional expression, which brings TTS Systems closer to human-level performance. Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies, and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles, context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool. The white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face Collection (https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4).

## CloneShield: A Framework for Universal Perturbation Against Zero-Shot Voice Cloning

- **Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.

## Revival with Voice: Multi-modal Controllable Text-to-Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models, such as Voicebox, E2 TTS, and F5-TTS, have attracted significant attention in recent years. These models require multiple sampling steps to reconstruct speech from noise, making inference speed a key challenge. Reducing the number of sampling steps can greatly improve inference efficiency. To this end, we introduce Fast F5-TTS, a training-free approach to accelerate the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. By inspecting the sampling trajectory of F5-TTS, we identify redundant steps and propose Empirically Pruned Step Sampling (EPSS), a non-uniform time-step sampling strategy that effectively reduces the number of sampling steps. Our approach achieves a 7-step generation with an inference RTF of 0.030 on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, making it 4 times faster than the original F5-TTS while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, EPSS performs well on E2 TTS models, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.
