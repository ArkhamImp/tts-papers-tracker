- **Abstract**: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

## UmbraTTS: Adapting Text-to-Speech to Environmental Contexts with Flow Matching

- **Abstract**: Zero-Shot Voice Conversion (VC) aims to transform the source speaker's timbre into an arbitrary unseen one while retaining speech content. Most prior work focuses on preserving the source's prosody, while fine-grained timbre information may leak through prosody, and transferring target prosody to synthesized speech is rarely studied. In light of this, we propose R-VC, a rhythm-controllable and efficient zero-shot voice conversion model. R-VC employs data perturbation techniques and discretize source speech into Hubert content tokens, eliminating much content-irrelevant information. By leveraging a Mask Generative Transformer for in-context duration modeling, our model adapts the linguistic content duration to the desired target speaking style, facilitating the transfer of the target speaker's rhythm. Furthermore, R-VC introduces a powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with shortcut flow matching during training, conditioning the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, enabling high timbre similarity and quality speech generation in fewer sampling steps, even in just two, thus minimizing latency. Experimental results show that R-VC achieves comparable speaker similarity to state-of-the-art VC methods with a smaller dataset, and surpasses them in terms of speech naturalness, intelligibility and style transfer performance.

## OmniDRCA: Parallel Speech-Text Foundation Model via Dual-Resolution Speech Representations and Contrastive Alignment

- **Abstract**: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.

## Ming-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Model for Perception and Generation

- **Abstract**: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for MX.
