- **Abstract**: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

- **Abstract**: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

## EchoFake: A Replay-Aware Dataset for Practical Speech Deepfake Detection

- **Abstract**: Flow-Matching (FM)-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems exhibit high-quality speech synthesis and robust generalization capabilities. However, the speaker representation ability of such systems remains underexplored, primarily due to the lack of explicit speaker-specific supervision in the FM framework. To this end, we conduct an empirical analysis of speaker information distribution and reveal its non-uniform allocation across time steps and network layers, underscoring the need for adaptive speaker alignment. Accordingly, we propose Time-Layer Adaptive Speaker Alignment (TLA-SA), a loss that enhances speaker consistency by jointly leveraging temporal and hierarchical variations in speaker information. Experimental results show that TLA-SA significantly improves speaker similarity compared to baseline systems on both research- and industrial-scale datasets and generalizes effectively across diverse model architectures, including decoder-only language models (LM) and FM-based TTS systems free of LM.

## VoiceMorph: How AI Voice Morphing Reveals the Boundaries of Auditory Self-Recognition

- **Abstract**: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.
