- **Abstract**: This research introduces a comprehensive Bahasa text-to-speech (TTS) dataset and a novel TTS model, EnGen-TTS, designed to enhance the quality and versatility of synthetic speech in the Bahasa language. The dataset, spanning \textasciitilde55.0 hours and 52K audio recordings, integrates diverse textual sources, ensuring linguistic richness. A meticulous recording setup captures the nuances of Bahasa phonetics, employing professional equipment to ensure high-fidelity audio samples. Statistical analysis reveals the dataset's scale and diversity, laying the foundation for model training and evaluation. The proposed EnGen-TTS model performs better than established baselines, achieving a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.45 $\pm$ 0.13. Additionally, our investigation on real-time factor and model size highlights EnGen-TTS as a compelling choice, with efficient performance. This research marks a significant advancement in Bahasa TTS technology, with implications for diverse language applications. Link to Generated Samples: \url{https://bahasa-harmony-comp.vercel.app/}

- **Abstract**: We present NanoVoice, a personalized text-to-speech model that efficiently constructs voice adapters for multiple speakers simultaneously. NanoVoice introduces a batch-wise speaker adaptation technique capable of fine-tuning multiple references in parallel, significantly reducing training time. Beyond building separate adapters for each speaker, we also propose a parameter sharing technique that reduces the number of parameters used for speaker adaptation. By incorporating a novel trainable scale matrix, NanoVoice mitigates potential performance degradation during parameter sharing. NanoVoice achieves performance comparable to the baselines, while training 4 times faster and using 45 percent fewer parameters for speaker adaptation with 40 reference voices. Extensive ablation studies and analysis further validate the efficiency of our model.

- **Abstract**: Semantic communication is a promising technology to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic information of the source data. However, traditional semantic communication methods primarily focus on data reconstruction tasks, which may not be efficient for emerging generative tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. To address this limitation, this paper develops a novel generative semantic communication framework for TTS synthesis, leveraging generative artificial intelligence technologies. Firstly, we utilize a pre-trained large speech model called WavLM and the residual vector quantization method to construct two semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The KB at the transmitter enables effective semantic extraction, while the KB at the receiver facilitates lifelike speech synthesis. Then, we employ a transformer encoder and a diffusion model to achieve efficient semantic coding without introducing significant communication overhead. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves much higher fidelity for the generated speech than four baselines, in both cases with additive white Gaussian noise channel and Rayleigh fading channel.
