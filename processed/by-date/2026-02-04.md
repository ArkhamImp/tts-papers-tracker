## PFluxTTS: Hybrid Flow-Matching TTS with Robust Cross-Lingual Voice Cloning and Inference-Time Model Fusion

- **Tags**: zero-shot, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: We present PFluxTTS, a hybrid text-to-speech system addressing three gaps in flow-matching TTS: the stability-naturalness trade-off, weak cross-lingual voice cloning, and limited audio quality from low-rate mel features. Our contributions are: (1) a dual-decoder design combining duration-guided and alignment-free models through inference-time vector-field fusion; (2) robust cloning using a sequence of speech-prompt embeddings in a FLUX-based decoder, preserving speaker traits across languages without prompt transcripts; and (3) a modified PeriodWave vocoder with super-resolution to 48 kHz. On cross-lingual in-the-wild data, PFluxTTS clearly outperforms F5-TTS, FishSpeech, and SparkTTS, matches ChatterBox in naturalness (MOS 4.11) while achieving 23% lower WER (6.9% vs. 9.0%), and surpasses ElevenLabs in speaker similarity (+0.32 SMOS). The system remains robust in challenging scenarios where most open-source models fail, while requiring only short reference audio and no extra training.

## WAXAL: A Large-Scale Multilingual African Language Speech Corpus

- **arXiv**: [2602.02734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02734)
- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.
