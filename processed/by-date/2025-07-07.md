## LAPS-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Singing Voice Synthesis With Language Aware Prosody-Style Guided Learning

- **Abstract**: Voice-based conversational AI systems increasingly rely on cascaded architectures that combine speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) components. We present a large-scale empirical comparison of STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data sampled from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. We used an LLM-as-a-Judge automated evaluation framework to assess conversational quality, technical accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities. Our analysis of five production configurations reveals that a stack combining Google's STT, GPT-4.1, and Cartesia's TTS outperforms alternatives in both objective quality metrics and user satisfaction scores. Surprisingly, we find that objective quality metrics correlate weakly with user satisfaction scores, suggesting that user experience in voice-based AI systems depends on factors beyond technical performance. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversations and contribute a validated evaluation methodology for human-AI interactions.

## Multi-Step Prediction and Control of Hierarchical Emotion Distribution in Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Sho Inoue et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2507.04598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04598)
- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent breakthroughs in intelligent speech and digital human technologies have primarily targeted mainstream adult users, often overlooking the distinct vocal patterns and interaction styles of seniors and children. These demographics possess distinct vocal characteristics, linguistic styles, and interaction patterns that challenge conventional ASR, TTS, and LLM systems. To address this, we introduce EchoVoices, an end-to-end digital human pipeline dedicated to creating persistent digital personas for seniors and children, ensuring their voices and memories are preserved for future generations. Our system integrates three core innovations: a k-NN-enhanced Whisper model for robust speech recognition of atypical speech; an age-adaptive VITS model for high-fidelity, speaker-aware speech synthesis; and an LLM-driven agent that automatically generates persona cards and leverages a RAG-based memory system for conversational consistency. Our experiments, conducted on the SeniorTalk and ChildMandarin datasets, demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy, synthesis quality, and speaker similarity. EchoVoices provides a comprehensive framework for preserving generational voices, offering a new means of intergenerational connection and the creation of lasting digital legacies.
