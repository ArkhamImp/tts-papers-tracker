- **Abstract**: Autoregressive diffusion models (ARDMs) have recently been applied to speech generation, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in zero-shot text-to-speech. By autoregressively generating continuous speech tokens with next-token diffusion, these models offer a promising alternative to next-token prediction, avoiding the technical complexities associated with discrete speech tokenization. As a relatively new paradigm, research on reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of speech ARDMs remains limited. In this paper, we propose Autoregressive Diffusion-Direct Preference Optimization (ARDM-DPO) to advance this research. By fine-tuning the recently proposed zero-shot text-to-speech model DiTAR with DPO, we achieve significant improvements in terms of speech expressiveness and robustness for long texts.

- **Abstract**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have played an important role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.

## Group Relative Policy Optimization for Text-to-Speech with Large Language Models

- **Abstract**: Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have shown high-quality speech synthesis. However, most current flow-matching-based TTS models still rely on reference transcripts corresponding to the audio prompt for synthesis. This dependency prevents cross-lingual voice cloning when audio prompt transcripts are unavailable, particularly for unseen languages. The key challenges for flow-matching-based TTS models to remove audio prompt transcripts are identifying word boundaries during training and determining appropriate duration during inference. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Lingual F5-TTS, a framework that enables cross-lingual voice cloning without audio prompt transcripts. Our method preprocesses audio prompts by forced alignment to obtain word boundaries, enabling direct synthesis from audio prompts while excluding transcripts during training. To address the duration modeling challenge, we train speaking rate predictors at different linguistic granularities to derive duration from speaker pace. Experiments show that our approach matches the performance of F5-TTS while enabling cross-lingual voice cloning.

## Explore the Reinforcement Learning for the LLM based ASR and TTS system

- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity, which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative \emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form, Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth, near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal modeling.

## No Verifiable Reward for Prosody: Toward Preference-Guided Prosody Learning in TTS

- **Tags**: expressive, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Spoken language models (SLMs) have emerged as a unified paradigm for speech understanding and generation, enabling natural human machine interaction. However, while most progress has focused on semantic accuracy and instruction following, the ability of SLMs to adapt their speaking style based on spoken instructions has received limited attention. We introduce Voice Style Adaptation (VSA), a new task that examines whether SLMs can modify their speaking style, such as timbre, prosody, or persona following natural language spoken commands. To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese &amp; English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge) framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness, style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task. By releasing VStyle and its evaluation toolkit, we aim to provide the community with a foundation for advancing human centered spoken interaction.
