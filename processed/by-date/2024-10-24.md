- **Abstract**: While automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance with large-scale datasets, their efficacy remains inadequate in low-resource settings, encompassing dialects, accents, minority languages, and long-tail hotwords, domains with significant practical relevance. With the advent of versatile and powerful text-to-speech (TTS) models, capable of generating speech with human-level naturalness, expressiveness, and diverse speaker profiles, leveraging TTS for ASR data augmentation provides a cost-effective and practical approach to enhancing ASR performance. Comprehensive experiments on an unprecedentedly rich variety of low-resource datasets demonstrate consistent and substantial performance improvements, proving that the proposed method of enhancing low-resource ASR through a versatile TTS model is highly effective and has broad application prospects. Furthermore, we delve deeper into key characteristics of synthesized speech data that contribute to ASR improvement, examining factors such as text diversity, speaker diversity, and the volume of synthesized data, with text diversity being studied for the first time in this work. We hope our findings provide helpful guidance and reference for the practical application of TTS-based data augmentation and push the advancement of low-resource ASR one step further.

## STTATTS: Unified Speech-To-Text And Text-To-Speech Model

- **Abstract**: Conversational Text-to-Speech (CTTS) aims to accurately express an utterance with the appropriate style within a conversational setting, which attracts more attention nowadays. While recognizing the significance of the CTTS task, prior studies have not thoroughly investigated speech emphasis expression, which is essential for conveying the underlying intention and attitude in human-machine interaction scenarios, due to the scarcity of conversational emphasis datasets and the difficulty in context understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel Emphasis Rendering scheme for the CTTS model, termed ER-CTTS, that includes two main components: 1) we simultaneously take into account textual and acoustic contexts, with both global and local semantic modeling to understand the conversation context comprehensively; 2) we deeply integrate multi-modal and multi-scale context to learn the influence of context on the emphasis expression of the current utterance. Finally, the inferred emphasis feature is fed into the neural speech synthesizer to generate conversational speech. To address data scarcity, we create emphasis intensity annotations on the existing conversational dataset (DailyTalk). Both objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the baseline models in emphasis rendering within a conversational setting.
