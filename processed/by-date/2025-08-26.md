- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly in speech synthesis, have enabled the generation of highly natural-sounding synthetic speech that closely mimics human voices. While these innovations hold promise for applications like assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing robustly to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples. This underscores its potential as a versatile solution for detecting evolving speech deepfake threats.

## CLEAR: Continuous Latent Autoregressive Modeling for High-quality and Low-latency Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: In recent years, text-to-speech (TTS) has seen impressive advancements through large-scale language models, achieving human-level speech quality. Integrating human feedback has proven effective for enhancing robustness in these systems. However, current approaches face challenges in optimizing TTS with preference data across multiple dimensions and often suffer from performance degradation due to overconfidence in rewards. We propose Multidimensional Preference Optimization (MPO) to better align TTS systems with human preferences. MPO introduces a preference set that streamlines the construction of data for multidimensional preference optimization, enabling alignment with multiple dimensions. Additionally, we incorporate regularization during training to address the typical degradation issues in DPO-based approaches. Our experiments demonstrate MPO's effectiveness, showing significant improvements in intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody compared to baseline systems.

## EMO-Reasoning: Benchmarking Emotional Reasoning Capabilities in Spoken Dialogue Systems
- **Authors**: Jingwen Liu et.al.

- **Tags**: expressive
- **Abstract**: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.
