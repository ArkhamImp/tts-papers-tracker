- **Abstract**: Pedagogical Agents (PAs) show significant potential for boosting student engagement and learning outcomes by providing adaptive, on-demand support in educational contexts. However, existing PA solutions are often hampered by pre-scripted dialogue, unnatural animations, uncanny visual realism, and high development costs. To address these gaps, we introduce VTutor, an open-source SDK leveraging lightweight WebGL, Unity, and JavaScript frameworks. VTutor receives text outputs from a large language model (LLM), converts them into audio via text-to-speech, and then renders a real-time, lip-synced pedagogical agent (PA) for immediate, large-scale deployment on web-based learning platforms. By providing on-demand, personalized feedback, VTutor strengthens students' motivation and deepens their engagement with instructional material. Using an anime-like aesthetic, VTutor alleviates the uncanny valley effect, allowing learners to engage with expressive yet comfortably stylized characters. Our evaluation with 50 participants revealed that VTutor significantly outperforms the existing talking-head approaches (e.g., SadTalker) on perceived synchronization accuracy, naturalness, emotional expressiveness, and overall preference. As an open-source project, VTutor welcomes community-driven contributions - from novel character designs to specialized showcases of pedagogical agent applications - that fuel ongoing innovation in AI-enhanced education. By providing an accessible, customizable, and learner-centered PA solution, VTutor aims to elevate human-AI interaction experience in education fields, ultimately broadening the impact of AI in learning contexts.

## Voila: Voice-Language Foundation Models for Real-Time Autonomous Interaction and Voice Role-Play
- **Authors**: Yemin Shi et.al.

- **Tags**: streaming, multilingual
- **Abstract**: Voice conversion (VC) systems are widely used for several applications, from speaker anonymisation to personalised speech synthesis. Supervised approaches learn a mapping between different speakers using parallel data, which is expensive to produce. Unsupervised approaches are typically trained to reconstruct the input signal, which is composed of the content and the speaker information. Disentangling these components is a challenge and often leads to speaker leakage or prosodic information removal. In this paper, we explore voice conversion by leveraging the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL). A combination of the latent representations of SSL models, concatenated with speaker embeddings, is fed to a vocoder which is trained to reconstruct the input. Zero-shot voice conversion results show that this approach allows to keep the prosody and content of the source speaker while matching the speaker similarity of a VC system based on phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs).

## LLaMA-Omni2: LLM-based Real-time Spoken Chatbot with Autoregressive Streaming Speech Synthesis
- **Authors**: Qingkai Fang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2505.02625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02625)
- **Tags**: streaming, llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) speech generation and voice cloning technologies have produced naturalistic speech and accurate voice replication, yet their influence on sociotechnical systems across diverse accents and linguistic traits is not fully understood. This study evaluates two synthetic AI voice services (Speechify and ElevenLabs) through a mixed methods approach using surveys and interviews to assess technical performance and uncover how users' lived experiences influence their perceptions of accent variations in these speech technologies. Our findings reveal technical performance disparities across five regional, English-language accents and demonstrate how current speech generation technologies may inadvertently reinforce linguistic privilege and accent-based discrimination, potentially creating new forms of digital exclusion. Overall, our study highlights the need for inclusive design and regulation by providing actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and organizations to ensure equitable and socially responsible AI speech technologies.
