- **Abstract**: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) promise higher expressive capability and stronger interpretability than Multi-Layer Perceptron, particularly in the domain of AI for Science. However, practical adoption has been hindered by low GPU utilization of existing parallel implementations. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated operator library, named PolyKAN which is the first general open-source implementation of KAN and its variants. PolyKAN fuses the forward and backward passes of polynomial KAN layers into a concise set of optimized CUDA kernels. Four orthogonal techniques underpin the design: (i) \emph{lookup-table} with linear interpolation that replaces runtime expensive math-library functions; (ii) \emph{2D tiling} to expose thread-level parallelism with preserving memory locality; (iii) a \emph{two-stage reduction} scheme converting scattered atomic updates into a single controllable merge step; and (iv) \emph{coefficient-layout reordering} yielding unit-stride reads under the tiled schedule. Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.

- **Abstract**: Achieving diverse and high-quality audio transformations from text prompts remains challenging, as existing methods are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on a limited set of differentiable audio effects. This paper proposes FxSearcher, a novel gradient-free framework that discovers the optimal configuration of audio effects (FX) to transform a source signal according to a text prompt. Our method employs Bayesian Optimization and CLAP-based score function to perform this search efficiently. Furthermore, a guiding prompt is introduced to prevent undesirable artifacts and enhance human preference. To objectively evaluate our method, we propose an AI-based evaluation framework. The results demonstrate that the highest scores achieved by our method on these metrics align closely with human preferences. Demos are available at https://hojoonki.github.io/FxSearcher/

- **Abstract**: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

- **Abstract**: Video-to-audio generation (V2A) is of increasing importance in domains such as film post-production, AR/VR, and sound design, particularly for the creation of Foley sound effects synchronized with on-screen actions. Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes. We benchmark several state-of-the-art V2A models, evaluating them on audio quality, audio-video alignment, temporal synchronization, and audio-text consistency.

- **Abstract**: The adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) is increasing to enhance Human-System Interaction (HSI) by creating immersive experiences that improve efficiency and safety in various industries. In industrial maintenance, traditional practices involve physical documentation and device interactions, which might disrupt the task, affect efficiency, and increase the cognitive load for the maintenance personnel. AR has the potential to support and enhance industrial maintenance processes in these aspects. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study and explore how advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), AR and speech processing can be integrated to support hands-free, real-time task logging and interaction in maintenance environments. This is done by developing a demonstrator for Microsoft HoloLens 2 using Unity, C#, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Functions, which enables speech-to-text transcription for hands-free maintenance support. Using Azures' speech recognition, the demonstrator can achieve high transcription accuracy in an AR environment, facilitating natural interactions between users and the augmented environment. The study aims to explore the potential of AR to reduce cognitive load, streamline workflows, and improve safety by enhancing HSI for maintenance personnel in high-stakes environments.

- **Abstract**: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

- **Abstract**: Generation of dynamic, scalable multi-species bird soundscapes remains a significant challenge in computer music and algorithmic sound design. Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research.
