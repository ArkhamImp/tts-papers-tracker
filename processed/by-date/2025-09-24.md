- **Abstract**: This work introduces MELA-TTS, a novel joint transformer-diffusion framework for end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. By autoregressively generating continuous mel-spectrogram frames from linguistic and speaker conditions, our architecture eliminates the need for speech tokenization and multi-stage processing pipelines. To address the inherent difficulties of modeling continuous features, we propose a representation alignment module that aligns output representations of the transformer decoder with semantic embeddings from a pretrained ASR encoder during training. This mechanism not only speeds up training convergence, but also enhances cross-modal coherence between the textual and acoustic domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MELA-TTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining robust zero-shot voice cloning capabilities, in both offline and streaming synthesis modes. Our results establish a new benchmark for continuous feature generation approaches in TTS, offering a compelling alternative to discrete-token-based paradigms.

## OLaPh: Optimal Language Phonemizer

- **Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have already reached a high degree of naturalness. However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

## CoMelSinger: Discrete Token-Based Zero-Shot Singing Synthesis With Structured Melody Control and Guidance

- **Tags**: zero-shot, codec
- **Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of speech generative models, unauthorized voice cloning poses significant privacy and security risks. Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.

## Eliminating stability hallucinations in llm-based tts models via attention guidance
- **Authors**: ShiMing Wang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2509.19852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19852)
- **Tags**: llm-based, synthesis
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a multi-label classification framework to detect multiple speaking styles in a speech sample. Unlike previous studies that have primarily focused on identifying a single target style, our framework effectively captures various speaker characteristics within a unified structure, making it suitable for generalized human-computer interaction applications. The proposed framework integrates cross-attention mechanisms within a transformer decoder to extract salient features associated with each target label from the input speech. To mitigate the data imbalance inherent in multi-label speech datasets, we employ a data augmentation technique based on a speech generation model. We validate our model's effectiveness through multiple objective evaluations on seen and unseen corpora. In addition, we provide an analysis of the influence of human perception on classification accuracy by considering the impact of human labeling agreement on model performance.

## Efficient Speech Watermarking for Speech Synthesis via Progressive Knowledge Distillation

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising, which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions. Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants. These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises. The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

## PART: Progressive Alignment Representation Training for Multilingual Speech-To-Text with LLMs

- **Abstract**: This paper presents DAIEN-TTS, a zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) framework that enables ENvironment-aware synthesis through Disentangled Audio Infilling. By leveraging separate speaker and environment prompts, DAIEN-TTS allows independent control over the timbre and the background environment of the synthesized speech. Built upon F5-TTS, the proposed DAIEN-TTS first incorporates a pretrained speech-environment separation (SES) module to disentangle the environmental speech into mel-spectrograms of clean speech and environment audio. Two random span masks of varying lengths are then applied to both mel-spectrograms, which, together with the text embedding, serve as conditions for infilling the masked environmental mel-spectrogram, enabling the simultaneous continuation of personalized speech and time-varying environmental audio. To further enhance controllability during inference, we adopt dual classifier-free guidance (DCFG) for the speech and environment components and introduce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation strategy to align the synthesized speech with the environment prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that DAIEN-TTS generates environmental personalized speech with high naturalness, strong speaker similarity, and high environmental fidelity.

## Selective Classifier-free Guidance for Zero-shot Text-to-speech

- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive vocal performances from structured musical inputs such as lyrics and pitch sequences. While recent progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt, compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture, CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens, preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive baselines.
