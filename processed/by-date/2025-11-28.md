- **Abstract**: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.

- **Abstract**: Voice communication in bandwidth-constrained environments--maritime, satellite, and tactical networks--remains prohibitively expensive. Traditional codecs struggle below 1 kbps, while existing semantic approaches (STT-TTS) sacrifice prosody and speaker identity. We present STCTS, a generative semantic compression framework enabling natural voice communication at 80 bps. STCTS explicitly decomposes speech into linguistic content, prosodic expression, and speaker timbre, applying tailored compression: context-aware text encoding (70 bps), sparse prosody transmission via TTS interpolation (&lt;14 bps at 0.1-1 Hz), and amortized speaker embedding. Evaluations on LibriSpeech demonstrate a 75x bitrate reduction versus Opus (6 kbps) and 12x versus EnCodec (1 kbps), while maintaining perceptual quality (NISQA MOS &gt; 4.26), graceful degradation under packet loss and noise resilience. We also discover a bimodal quality distribution with prosody sampling rate: sparse and dense updates both achieve high quality, while mid-range rates degrade due to perceptual discontinuities--guiding optimal configuration design. Beyond efficiency, our modular architecture supports privacy-preserving encryption, human-interpretable transmission, and flexible deployment on edge devices, offering a robust solution for ultra-low bandwidth scenarios.
