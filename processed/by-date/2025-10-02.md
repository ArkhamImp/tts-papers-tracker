- **Abstract**: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge, hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0 contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units, which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.

## MOSS-Speech: Towards True Speech-to-Speech Models Without Text Guidance

- **Abstract**: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.
