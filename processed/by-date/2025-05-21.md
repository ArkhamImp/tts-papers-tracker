- **Abstract**: Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from unlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we developed an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve human-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss kappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by human annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we further released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2 hours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice cloning.

## MIKU-PAL: An Automated and Standardized Multi-Modal Method for Speech Paralinguistic and Affect Labeling

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in discrete audio codecs have significantly improved speech representation modeling, while codec language models have enabled in-context learning for zero-shot speech synthesis. Inspired by this, we propose a voice conversion (VC) model within the VALLE-X framework, leveraging its strong in-context learning capabilities for speaker adaptation. To enhance prosody control, we introduce a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) module, which isolates and refines prosody from other sources, improving expressiveness and control. By integrating PACE into our VC model, we achieve greater flexibility in prosody manipulation while preserving speaker timbre. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline VC systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and overall naturalness, surpassing baseline VC systems.

- **Abstract**: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.

## Audio Jailbreak: An Open Comprehensive Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Audio-Language Models

- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision, enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

## Prosody-Adaptable Audio Codecs for Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via In-Context Learning

- **Abstract**: We present LipDiffuser, a conditional diffusion model for lip-to-speech generation synthesizing natural and intelligible speech directly from silent video recordings. Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition. These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment.

- **Abstract**: We introduce RASMALAI, a large-scale speech dataset with rich text descriptions, designed to advance controllable and expressive text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis for 23 Indian languages and English. It comprises 13,000 hours of speech and 24 million text-description annotations with fine-grained attributes like speaker identity, accent, emotion, style, and background conditions. Using RASMALAI, we develop IndicParlerTTS, the first open-source, text-description-guided TTS for Indian languages. Systematic evaluation demonstrates its ability to generate high-quality speech for named speakers, reliably follow text descriptions and accurately synthesize specified attributes. Additionally, it effectively transfers expressive characteristics both within and across languages. IndicParlerTTS consistently achieves strong performance across these evaluations, setting a new standard for controllable multilingual expressive speech synthesis in Indian languages.

## AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models

- **Tags**: multilingual
- **Abstract**: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.
