- **Abstract**: We present STT4SG-350 (Speech-to-Text for Swiss German), a corpus of Swiss German speech, annotated with Standard German text at the sentence level. The data is collected using a web app in which the speakers are shown Standard German sentences, which they translate to Swiss German and record. We make the corpus publicly available. It contains 343 hours of speech from all dialect regions and is the largest public speech corpus for Swiss German to date. Application areas include automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech, dialect identification, and speaker recognition. Dialect information, age group, and gender of the 316 speakers are provided. Genders are equally represented and the corpus includes speakers of all ages. Roughly the same amount of speech is provided per dialect region, which makes the corpus ideally suited for experiments with speech technology for different dialects. We provide training, validation, and test splits of the data. The test set consists of the same spoken sentences for each dialect region and allows a fair evaluation of the quality of speech technologies in different dialects. We train an ASR model on the training set and achieve an average BLEU score of 74.7 on the test set. The model beats the best published BLEU scores on 2 other Swiss German ASR test sets, demonstrating the quality of the corpus.

## StyleTTS: A Style-Based Generative Model for Natural and Diverse Text-to-Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Prosodic boundary plays an important role in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) in terms of naturalness and readability. However, the acquisition of prosodic boundary labels relies on manual annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to automatically extract prosodic boundary labels from text-audio data via a neural text-speech model with pre-trained audio encoders. This model is pre-trained on text and speech data separately and jointly fine-tuned on TTS data in a triplet format: {speech, text, prosody}. The experimental results on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation demonstrate that: 1) the proposed text-speech prosody annotation framework significantly outperforms text-only baselines; 2) the quality of automatic prosodic boundary annotations is comparable to human annotations; 3) TTS systems trained with model-annotated boundaries are slightly better than systems that use manual ones.
