- **Abstract**: Generative Error Correction (GEC) has emerged as a powerful post-processing method to enhance the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. However, we show that GEC models struggle to generalize beyond the specific types of errors encountered during training, limiting their ability to correct new, unseen errors at test time, particularly in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. This phenomenon amplifies with named entities (NEs), where, in addition to insufficient contextual information or knowledge about the NEs, novel NEs keep emerging. To address these issues, we propose DARAG (Data- and Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction), a novel approach designed to improve GEC for ASR in in-domain (ID) and OOD scenarios. We augment the GEC training dataset with synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs and text-to-speech models, thereby simulating additional errors from which the model can learn. For OOD scenarios, we simulate test-time errors from new domains similarly and in an unsupervised fashion. Additionally, to better handle named entities, we introduce retrieval-augmented correction by augmenting the input with entities retrieved from a database. Our approach is simple, scalable, and both domain- and language-agnostic. We experiment on multiple datasets and settings, showing that DARAG outperforms all our baselines, achieving 8\% -- 30\% relative WER improvements in ID and 10\% -- 33\% improvements in OOD settings.

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in speech synthesis tasks, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning. However, their iterative denoising processes are computationally intensive, and previous distillation attempts have shown consistent quality degradation. Moreover, existing TTS approaches are limited by non-differentiable components or iterative sampling that prevent true end-to-end optimization with perceptual metrics. We introduce DMOSpeech, a distilled diffusion-based TTS model that uniquely achieves both faster inference and superior performance compared to its teacher model. By enabling direct gradient pathways to all model components, we demonstrate the first successful end-to-end optimization of differentiable metrics in TTS, incorporating Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and Speaker Verification (SV) loss. Our comprehensive experiments, validated through extensive human evaluation, show significant improvements in naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity while reducing inference time by orders of magnitude. This work establishes a new framework for aligning speech synthesis with human auditory preferences through direct metric optimization.

## Facial Expression-Enhanced TTS: Combining Face Representation and Emotion Intensity for Adaptive Speech

- **Abstract**: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems that scale up the amount of training data have achieved significant improvements in zero-shot speech synthesis. However, these systems have certain limitations: they require a large amount of training data, which increases costs, and often overlook prosody similarity. To address these issues, we propose MultiVerse, a zero-shot multi-task TTS system that is able to perform TTS or speech style transfer in zero-shot and cross-lingual conditions. MultiVerse requires much less training data than traditional data-driven approaches. To ensure zero-shot performance even with limited data, we leverage source-filter theory-based disentanglement, utilizing the prompt for modeling filter-related and source-related representations. Additionally, to further enhance prosody similarity, we adopt a prosody modeling approach combining prompt-based autoregressive and non-autoregressive methods. Evaluations demonstrate the remarkable zero-shot multi-task TTS performance of MultiVerse and show that MultiVerse not only achieves zero-shot TTS performance comparable to data-driven TTS systems with much less data, but also significantly outperforms other zero-shot TTS systems trained with the same small amount of data. In particular, our novel prosody modeling technique significantly contributes to MultiVerse's ability to generate speech with high prosody similarity to the given prompts. Our samples are available at https://nc-ai.github.io/speech/publications/multiverse/index.html

## NanoVoice: Efficient Speaker-Adaptive Text-to-Speech for Multiple Speakers

- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: We propose a novel description-based controllable text-to-speech (TTS) method with cross-lingual control capability. To address the lack of audio-description paired data in the target language, we combine a TTS model trained on the target language with a description control model trained on another language, which maps input text descriptions to the conditional features of the TTS model. These two models share disentangled timbre and style representations based on self-supervised learning (SSL), allowing for disentangled voice control, such as controlling speaking styles while retaining the original timbre. Furthermore, because the SSL-based timbre and style representations are language-agnostic, combining the TTS and description control models while sharing the same embedding space effectively enables cross-lingual control of voice characteristics. Experiments on English and Japanese TTS demonstrate that our method achieves high naturalness and controllability for both languages, even though no Japanese audio-description pairs are used.

## VoiceGuider: Enhancing Out-of-Domain Performance in Parameter-Efficient Speaker-Adaptive Text-to-Speech via Autoguidance

- **Abstract**: Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based sequence models are known to have difficulty generalizing to sequences longer than those seen during training. When applied to text-to-speech (TTS), these models tend to drop or repeat words or produce erratic output, especially for longer utterances. In this paper, we introduce enhancements aimed at AR Transformer-based encoder-decoder TTS systems that address these robustness and length generalization issues. Our approach uses an alignment mechanism to provide cross-attention operations with relative location information. The associated alignment position is learned as a latent property of the model via backpropagation and requires no external alignment information during training. While the approach is tailored to the monotonic nature of TTS input-output alignment, it is still able to benefit from the flexible modeling power of interleaved multi-head self- and cross-attention operations. A system incorporating these improvements, which we call Very Attentive Tacotron, matches the naturalness and expressiveness of a baseline T5-based TTS system, while eliminating problems with repeated or dropped words and enabling generalization to any practical utterance length.

## StyleFusion TTS: Multimodal Style-control and Enhanced Feature Fusion for Zero-shot Text-to-speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Recent work has shown the feasibility and benefit of bootstrapping an integrated sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) linguistic frontend from a traditional pipeline-based frontend for text-to-speech (TTS). To overcome the fixed lexical coverage of bootstrapping training data, previous work has proposed to leverage easily accessible transcribed speech audio as an additional training source for acquiring novel pronunciation knowledge for uncovered words, which relies on an auxiliary ASR model as part of a cumbersome implementation flow. In this work, we propose an alternative method to leverage transcribed speech audio as an additional training source, based on multi-task learning (MTL). Experiments show that, compared to a baseline Seq2Seq frontend, the proposed MTL-based method reduces PER from 2.5% to 1.6% for those word types covered exclusively in transcribed speech audio, achieving a similar performance to the previous method but with a much simpler implementation flow.
