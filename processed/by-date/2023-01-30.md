- **Abstract**: Speech synthesis and music audio generation from symbolic input differ in many aspects but share some similarities. In this study, we investigate how text-to-speech synthesis techniques can be used for piano MIDI-to-audio synthesis tasks. Our investigation includes Tacotron and neural source-filter waveform models as the basic components, with which we build MIDI-to-audio synthesis systems in similar ways to TTS frameworks. We also include reference systems using conventional sound modeling techniques such as sample-based and physical-modeling-based methods. The subjective experimental results demonstrate that the investigated TTS components can be applied to piano MIDI-to-audio synthesis with minor modifications. The results also reveal the performance bottleneck -- while the waveform model can synthesize high quality piano sound given natural acoustic features, the conversion from MIDI to acoustic features is challenging. The full MIDI-to-audio synthesis system is still inferior to the sample-based or physical-modeling-based approaches, but we encourage TTS researchers to test their TTS models for this new task and improve the performance.
