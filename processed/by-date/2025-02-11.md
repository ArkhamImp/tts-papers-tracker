## LoRP-TTS: Low-Rank Personalized Text-To-Speech
- **Authors**: Łukasz Bondaruk et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2502.07562](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07562)
- **Tags**: synthesis
- **Abstract**: Pre-training and representation learning have been playing an increasingly important role in modern speech processing. Nevertheless, different applications have been relying on different foundation models, since predominant pre-training techniques are either designed for discriminative tasks or generative tasks. In this work, we make the first attempt at building a unified pre-training framework for both types of tasks in speech. We show that with the appropriate design choices for pre-training, one can jointly learn a representation encoder and generative audio decoder that can be applied to both types of tasks. We propose UniWav, an encoder-decoder framework designed to unify pre-training representation learning and generative tasks. On speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech tokenization, UniWav achieves comparable performance to different existing foundation models, each trained on a specific task. Our findings suggest that a single general-purpose foundation model for speech can be built to replace different foundation models, reducing the overhead and cost of pre-training.

## Advanced Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech for Background Removal and Preservation with Controllable Masked Speech Prediction
- **Authors**: Leying Zhang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2502.07345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07345)
- **Tags**: zero-shot, synthesis
- **Abstract**: In recent years, several text-to-speech systems have been proposed to synthesize natural speech in zero-shot, few-shot, and low-resource scenarios. However, these methods typically require training with data from many different speakers. The speech quality across the speaker set typically is diverse and imposes an upper limit on the quality achievable for the low-resource speaker. In the current work, we achieve high-quality speech synthesis using as little as five minutes of speech from the desired speaker by augmenting the low-resource speaker data with noise and employing multiple sampling techniques during training. Our method requires only four high-quality, high-resource speakers, which are easy to obtain and use in practice. Our low-complexity method achieves improved speaker similarity compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot method HierSpeech++ and the recent low-resource method AdapterMix while maintaining comparable naturalness. Our proposed approach can also reduce the data requirements for speech synthesis for new speakers and languages.

## Vevo: Controllable Zero-Shot Voice Imitation with Self-Supervised Disentanglement
- **Authors**: Xueyao Zhang et.al.
- **arXiv**: [2502.07243](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07243)
- **Tags**: zero-shot
- **Abstract**: We propose a unified framework for Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) and Conversion (SVC), addressing the limitations of existing approaches in cross-domain SVS/SVC, poor output musicality, and scarcity of singing data. Our framework enables control over multiple aspects, including language content based on lyrics, performance attributes based on a musical score, singing style and vocal techniques based on a selector, and voice identity based on a speech sample. The proposed zero-shot learning paradigm consists of one SVS model and two SVC models, utilizing pre-trained content embeddings and a diffusion-based generator. The proposed framework is also trained on mixed datasets comprising both singing and speech audio, allowing singing voice cloning based on speech reference. Experiments show substantial improvements in timbre similarity and musicality over state-of-the-art baselines, providing insights into other low-data music tasks such as instrumental style transfer.
