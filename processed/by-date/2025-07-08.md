- **Abstract**: We present a speaker conditioned text-to-speech (TTS) system aimed at addressing challenges in generating speech for unseen speakers and supporting diverse Indian languages. Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific speaker-conditioned models. Using the IndicSUPERB dataset for multiple Indian languages such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Punjabi and Tamil.

- **Abstract**: Advances in voice conversion and text-to-speech synthesis have made automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems more susceptible to spoofing attacks. This work explores modest refinements to the AASIST anti-spoofing architecture. It incorporates a frozen Wav2Vec 2.0 encoder to retain self-supervised speech representations in limited-data settings, substitutes the original graph attention block with a standardized multi-head attention module using heterogeneous query projections, and replaces heuristic frame-segment fusion with a trainable, context-aware integration layer. When evaluated on the ASVspoof 5 corpus, the proposed system reaches a 7.6\% equal error rate (EER), improving on a re-implemented AASIST baseline under the same training conditions. Ablation experiments suggest that each architectural change contributes to the overall performance, indicating that targeted adjustments to established models may help strengthen speech deepfake detection in practical scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/KORALLLL/AASIST_SCALING.

## OpenS2S: Advancing Fully Open-Source End-to-End Empathetic Large Speech Language Model

- **Tags**: multilingual, llm-based
- **Abstract**: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches. However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.

## SpeechAccentLLM: A Unified Framework for Foreign Accent Conversion and Text to Speech

- **Tags**: llm-based
- **Abstract**: This work addresses the development of a database for the automatic assessment of text-to-speech (TTS) systems in Spanish, aiming to improve the accuracy of naturalness prediction models. The dataset consists of 4,326 audio samples from 52 different TTS systems and human voices and is, up to our knowledge, the first of its kind in Spanish. To label the audios, a subjective test was designed based on the ITU-T Rec. P.807 standard and completed by 92 participants. Furthermore, the utility of the collected dataset was validated by training automatic naturalness prediction systems. We explored two approaches: fine-tuning an existing model originally trained for English, and training small downstream networks on top of frozen self-supervised speech models. Our models achieve a mean absolute error of 0.8 on a five-point MOS scale. Further analysis demonstrates the quality and diversity of the developed dataset, and its potential to advance TTS research in Spanish.
