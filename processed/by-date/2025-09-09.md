- **Abstract**: Tibetan is a low-resource language with limited parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects (Ü-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham), limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose TMD-TTS, a unified Tibetan multi-dialect text-to-speech (TTS) framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from explicit dialect labels. Our method features a dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that TMD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in dialectal expressiveness. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging Speech-to-Speech Dialect Conversion (S2SDC) task.

## Progressive Facial Granularity Aggregation with Bilateral Attribute-based Enhancement for Face-to-Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining.

## When Fine-Tuning is Not Enough: Lessons from HSAD on Hybrid and Adversarial Audio Spoof Detection

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues. Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care, mental health, and human-centered AI.

## Speaker Privacy and Security in the Big Data Era: Protection and Defense against Deepfake

- **Abstract**: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years -- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges. However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency, explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in engineering education.
