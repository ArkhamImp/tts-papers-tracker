- **Abstract**: Accurate control of the total duration of generated speech by adjusting the speech rate is crucial for various text-to-speech (TTS) applications. However, the impact of adjusting the speech rate on speech quality, such as intelligibility and speaker characteristics, has been underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel total-duration-aware (TDA) duration model for TTS, where phoneme durations are predicted not only from the text input but also from an additional input of the total target duration. We also propose a MaskGIT-based duration model that enhances the diversity and quality of the predicted phoneme durations. Our results demonstrate that the proposed TDA duration models achieve better intelligibility and speaker similarity for various speech rate configurations compared to the baseline models. We also show that the proposed MaskGIT-based model can generate phoneme durations with higher quality and diversity compared to its regression or flow-matching counterparts.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in text-to-speech have significantly improved the expressiveness of synthetic speech. However, a major challenge remains in generating speech that captures the diverse styles exhibited by professional narrators in audiobooks without relying on manually labeled data or reference speech. To address this problem, we propose a text-aware and context-aware(TACA) style modeling approach for expressive audiobook speech synthesis. We first establish a text-aware style space to cover diverse styles via contrastive learning with the supervision of the speech style. Meanwhile, we adopt a context encoder to incorporate cross-sentence information and the style embedding obtained from text. Finally, we introduce the context encoder to two typical TTS models, VITS-based TTS and language model-based TTS. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can effectively capture diverse styles and coherent prosody, and consequently improves naturalness and expressiveness in audiobook speech synthesis.

- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in generative models have sparked a significant interest within the machine learning community. Particularly, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images and speech. Studies such as those by Lee et al. (2023), Black et al. (2023), Wang et al. (2023), and Fan et al. (2024) illustrate that Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can enhance diffusion models for image synthesis. However, due to architectural differences between these models and those employed in speech synthesis, it remains uncertain whether RLHF could similarly benefit speech synthesis models. In this paper, we explore the practical application of RLHF to diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging the mean opinion score (MOS) as predicted by UTokyo-SaruLab MOS prediction system (Saeki et al., 2022) as a proxy loss. We introduce diffusion model loss-guided RL policy optimization (DLPO) and compare it against other RLHF approaches, employing the NISQA speech quality and naturalness assessment model (Mittag et al., 2021) and human preference experiments for further evaluation. Our results show that RLHF can enhance diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis models, and, moreover, DLPO can better improve diffusion models in generating natural and high quality speech audios.

## Controlling Emotion in Text-to-Speech with Natural Language Prompts

- **Tags**: expressive, multilingual, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Recent language model-based text-to-speech (TTS) frameworks demonstrate scalability and in-context learning capabilities. However, they suffer from robustness issues due to the accumulation of errors in speech unit predictions during autoregressive language modeling. In this paper, we propose a phonetic enhanced language modeling method to improve the performance of TTS models. We leverage self-supervised representations that are phonetically rich as the training target for the autoregressive language model. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive model is employed to predict discrete acoustic codecs that contain fine-grained acoustic details. The TTS model focuses solely on linguistic modeling during autoregressive training, thereby reducing the error propagation that occurs in non-autoregressive training. Both objective and subjective evaluations validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

## WenetSpeech4TTS: A 12,800-hour Mandarin TTS Corpus for Large Speech Generation Model Benchmark

- **Tags**: long-context, synthesis
- **Abstract**: Although current Text-To-Speech (TTS) models are able to generate high-quality speech samples, there are still challenges in developing emotion intensity controllable TTS. Most existing TTS models achieve emotion intensity control by extracting intensity information from reference speeches. Unfortunately, limited by the lack of modeling for intra-class emotion intensity and the model's information decoupling capability, the generated speech cannot achieve fine-grained emotion intensity control and suffers from information leakage issues. In this paper, we propose an emotion transfer TTS model, which defines a remapping-based sorting method to model intra-class relative intensity information, combined with Mutual Information (MI) to decouple speaker and emotion information, and synthesizes expressive speeches with perceptible intensity differences. Experiments show that our model achieves fine-grained emotion control while preserving speaker information.

## Text-aware and Context-aware Expressive Audiobook Speech Synthesis

- **Abstract**: Scaling text-to-speech (TTS) with autoregressive language model (LM) to large-scale datasets by quantizing waveform into discrete speech tokens is making great progress to capture the diversity and expressiveness in human speech, but the speech reconstruction quality from discrete speech token is far from satisfaction depending on the compressed speech token compression ratio. Generative diffusion models trained with score-matching loss and continuous normalized flow trained with flow-matching loss have become prominent in generation of images as well as speech. LM based TTS systems usually quantize speech into discrete tokens and generate these tokens autoregressively, and finally use a diffusion model to up sample coarse-grained speech tokens into fine-grained codec features or mel-spectrograms before reconstructing into waveforms with vocoder, which has a high latency and is not realistic for real time speech applications. In this paper, we systematically investigate varied diffusion models for up sampling stage, which is the main bottleneck for streaming synthesis of LM and diffusion-based architecture, we present the model architecture, objective and subjective metrics to show quality and efficiency improvement.
