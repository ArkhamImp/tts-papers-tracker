Evaluation is conducted on three held-out real emotional datasets: MSP-Podcast Test1, Test2 (English podcast clips with dimensional emotion annotations), and IEMOCAP (dyadic acted conversations with categorical and dimensional labels). No real emotional data is used in training. Metrics include WER overall and stratified by emotional expressiveness. Baselines include vanilla fine-tuning on unfiltered synthetic data and the original pretrained model.",

Crucially, performance on LibriSpeech (neutral) remains stable (WER change < 0.1%), confirming no degradation. Gains are most pronounced in high-arousal/high-valence regions. The combined TTS-EMO-G strategy consistently outperforms individual strategies across all benchmarks, achieving the best average WER of 14.2% on real emotional datasets.",

Ablation studies showed that reference-guided conditioning significantly improved Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) but required careful balancing to avoid WER degradation. CosyEdit demonstrated stable performance across diverse editing operations, whereas competitors like Step-Audio-EditX exhibited high variance. The model preserved speaker identity and prosodic continuity better than alternatives, indicating strong consistency between pre- and post-edit speech.",

The reference-guided CFM vocoder effectively preserves speaker characteristics and global prosody, critical for natural-sounding edits. The approach is computationally efficient compared to training large SLMs from scratch and scales well due to its modular fine-tuning strategy.",

Waveforms are reconstructed via inverse STFT without additional refinement. Training uses a multi-objective loss function comprising: (1) an adversarial loss using a lightweight discriminator inspired by HiFi-GAN, (2) a spectral reconstruction loss on magnitude and phase, and (3) a phase-aware loss that penalizes phase inconsistencies, particularly around voiced regions.

Its core contribution is a training-free method that enables dynamic, intra-utterance control over both emotion and duration in pretrained zero-shot TTS models. This is accomplished through two novel strategies: (1) segment-aware emotion conditioning using causal masking and monotonic stream alignment filtering to allow smooth emotion transitions while maintaining semantic coherence, and (2) segment-aware duration steering combining local duration embedding adjustments with global end-of-sentence (EOS) logit modulation to ensure consistent utterance termination. Additionally, the authors construct a 30,000-sample multi-emotion and duration-annotated text dataset (MED-TTS) to automate prompt generation via an LLM, eliminating manual prompt engineering.",
    "technical_approach": "The method operates on a pretrained autoregressive zero-shot TTS model without any fine-tuning. For emotion control, it employs a segment-aware conditioning strategy that partitions the input text into segments and applies causal masking during inference to isolate emotion embeddings per segment. Monotonic Stream Alignment (MSA) filtering ensures alignment between text and acoustic tokens remains monotonic, preventing drift and preserving coherence during emotion shifts. For duration control, the approach uses local steering of duration embeddings derived from text prompts while globally modulating EOS logits to avoid premature or delayed termination. Prompt construction is automated using Qwen3, a large language model fine-tuned on the MED-TTS dataset, which contains text annotated with emotion labels and relative duration tags. The framework is evaluated on both autoregressive (e.g., F5TTS) and non-autoregressive (e.g., MaskGCT) TTS architectures using objective metrics like Word Error Rate (WER), DNSM (duration naturalness score metric), and subjective MOS across emotion fidelity, naturalness, consistency, and intelligibility.",

For duration control, it attains lower WER and higher DNSM scores across scaling factors (0.8x to 1.2x), indicating better duration adherence without quality degradation. Subjective evaluations confirm smoother emotion transitions and more natural duration variation compared to methods that synthesize segments independently.

The ASR loss ensures linguistic fidelity, while the reconstruction loss preserves prosodic structure. A weighting parameter α balances these two objectives.

The innovation lies in using the intrinsic likelihood modeling capability of pretrained LALMs—via in-context learning—to compute the log-probability of ground-truth speech continuations conditioned on model-generated speech, thereby capturing dynamic, context-sensitive stylistic coherence across multi-turn dialogues rather than treating style as static or attribute-based.",

In the GRPO stage, the reward combines MCLP and Word Error Rate (WER) to jointly optimize for content fidelity and stylistic alignment. MCLP is computed by feeding the generated speech (converted to text via ASR) along with context into a frozen pretrained LALM and measuring the average log-probability of the ground-truth continuation tokens.

Notably, while baseline models degrade without audio history, the proposed method maintains robust performance, demonstrating effective use of textual context alone.

The final dataset uses a hierarchical JSON format where each surah contains verses, each verse includes Arabic text, English translation, transliteration, and multiple audio recordings (one per reciter), and each word is linked to its audio segment via timestamps.

The final dataset includes 32 reciters (slightly more than the source Kaggle set), covering all 6,236 verses of the Quran. Each entry includes surah/verse identifiers, Arabic text, English translation (likely from Saheeh International), Buckwalter or similar transliteration, and audio paths with implied word-level timestamps. Evaluation metrics are not reported as part of experiments since the paper is a dataset release; instead, Table 1 compares Quran-MD against 8 prior datasets (e.g., Tarteel, RetaSy, QDAT) across features like reciter count, modality, alignment level, and tajweed support.

Translations and transliterations appear to use single sources without variant options, potentially limiting linguistic nuance. There is no validation of alignment accuracy (e.g., via human evaluation or WER on forced alignment). Additionally, while 32 reciters are included, representation across the canonical ten qira’at (recitation schools) is not explicitly verified. Metadata such as reciter biographies or qira’at affiliations is absent, reducing cultural context.",

They evaluate nine representative MLLMs spanning commercial (Gemini 2.0/2.5 families) and open-source models (Gemma 3n, Voxtral, Phi 4), accessed via official APIs.

Experimental variables include language (English, Chinese, Korean), speaker gender (male/female), accent (native/non-native within each language), and structural perturbation via option-order reversal. Post-processing normalizes model outputs to standard answer formats (A–D). Four evaluation metrics are used: (1) accuracy (% correct), (2) entropy of answer distribution (measuring prediction uncertainty), (3) APES (Answer Perturbation Effect Score, quantifying sensitivity to input perturbations), and (4) Fleiss’ κ (assessing inter-model consistency across perturbed conditions).

Dataset construction involved excluding STEM questions to focus on social sciences/humanities, then generating speech using TTS with balanced representation across three languages, two genders, and native/non-native accents per language. Human evaluators assessed TTS naturalness and intelligibility. Nine models from four families were evaluated under identical audio inputs across all variable combinations. Baselines include both end-to-end audio-language models and pipeline approaches (ASR + LLM). Evaluation metrics: accuracy measures correctness; entropy captures output distribution uncertainty; APES computes the L1 distance between answer distributions under perturbed vs. original inputs; Fleiss’ κ evaluates agreement among model predictions across perturbations. Statistical robustness is assessed via interquartile ranges and cross-variable interaction plots. Model scale effects are analyzed within families (e.g., Gemma variants), and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) are tested for impact on robustness.",

(2) Language has the strongest effect: average accuracy drops from ~72% in English to ~58% in Korean across models. (3) Gender and accent show minimal impact: accuracy differences <2% between male/female speakers and native/non-native accents within each language. (4) Larger models (e.g., Gemma 120B) achieve higher Fleiss’ κ (>0.65) and lower APES (<0.15), indicating greater robustness. (5) End-to-end models outperform pipeline models in consistency (higher κ) despite similar accuracy, suggesting joint audio-language training stabilizes predictions. (6) Reasoning complexity (e.g., CoT) does not consistently improve robustness and sometimes increases APES. Qualitatively, models exhibit high entropy in low-resource languages (Korean), reflecting uncertainty, and structural biases (option order) dominate over demographic ones—a contrast to findings in pure text-based bias studies.",

The release of BiasInEar fills a critical resource gap for speech bias research. Use of both commercial and open-source models ensures broad relevance. The combination of APES and Fleiss’ κ offers nuanced insights beyond accuracy, capturing both sensitivity and consensus. Human validation of TTS quality strengthens dataset credibility. Cross-architectural comparisons reveal meaningful patterns about design choices (e.g., end-to-end vs. pipeline).",
    "limitations": "The dataset is limited to three languages and excludes STEM domains, reducing generalizability. TTS-generated speech may lack natural prosody, emotional variation, or real-world noise, potentially underestimating ASR-related errors. Accent representation is simplified (binary native/non-native) and may not reflect true dialectal diversity. Only multiple-choice QA tasks are evaluated, ignoring open-ended or conversational settings. Commercial models are accessed via black-box APIs, limiting insight into internal mechanisms.

Existing systems often fail to disentangle these factors, leading to style leakage or poor instruction adherence. FlexiVoice solves this by integrating an LLM-based architecture with a three-stage Progressive Post-Training (PPT) pipeline that progressively aligns and disentangles control signals using reinforcement learning techniques (DPO and GRPO), enabling precise, flexible, and robust multi-modal control in a zero-shot setting.",

Human evaluations confirm superior naturalness and controllability, especially in conflict scenarios (e.g., neutral text with 'excited' instruction). The PPT ablation shows that progressive training is essential: joint GRPO optimization causes interference, while S3-first fails due to lack of foundational disentanglement. Reward model validation shows Kimi-Audio-7B achieves high Macro-F1 (Table 7) against Gemini, confirming its suitability.

They evaluate nine state-of-the-art LALMs (including Gemini-2.5-Flash and others) alongside three speaker embedding baselines: ECAPA-TDNN, WavLM, and another unspecified method. The evaluation includes three tasks: (1) Consistency Verification: given a sequence of audio turns from one speaker, judge if consistent; (2) Inconsistency Localization: identify which turn breaks speaker identity; (3) Discrimination: choose the best-matching audio among three variants for a target speaker.

Instances are created by splicing consistent/inconsistent speaker turns, including obvious manipulations like gender switches. Three tasks are defined: (1) Binary consistency classification; (2) Turn-level inconsistency localization; (3) Multi-choice acoustic matching. Nine LALMs are evaluated in zero-shot settings using only audio input, with additional ablations testing performance when interlocutor turns are included. Baselines include three speaker embedding models: ECAPA-TDNN, WavLM, and a third method, all using cosine similarity with tuned thresholds. Evaluation metrics focus on accuracy, with human verification ensuring label correctness. The experimental design controls for acoustic difficulty and tests generalization across domains.",
    "key_findings": "LALMs perform poorly on speaker consistency tasks: most score below 50% on binary verification, with Gemini-2.5-Flash achieving only 60.1%. On inconsistency localization, models fail to identify problematic turns, often defaulting to 'consistent' judgments. Performance collapses (<10% accuracy on hard cases S2/S3) when interlocutor context is added, as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues—even missing obvious gender switches. In contrast, speaker embedding methods achieve near-perfect accuracy (99–100% for ECAPA-TDNN) on verification. However, LALMs excel in the discrimination task (up to 82.6% accuracy), showing they possess acoustic discrimination capability but fail to apply it in contextual consistency judgments. This reveals a systematic text bias: LALMs rely on implicit textual assumptions rather than acoustic evidence when evaluating speaker identity across turns.",

The three-task design isolates distinct cognitive demands of speaker consistency evaluation. The inclusion of both synthetic and real speech enhances ecological validity. Direct comparison with established speaker embedding methods provides a strong baseline for assessing LALM limitations. The ablation with interlocutor context effectively demonstrates the text bias phenomenon. The use of multiple LALMs across architectures enables generalizable conclusions about model behavior.",
    "limitations": "The paper does not analyze internal model mechanisms causing text bias (e.g., attention patterns or modality fusion strategies). Evaluation is limited to zero-shot settings; fine-tuned LALMs might perform differently. The discrimination task uses only three candidates, which may oversimplify real-world selection scenarios. Dataset diversity, while improved, still lacks non-English or accented speech. The human verification process, while present, is not detailed in terms of inter-annotator agreement or protocol. Some LALM names and architectures are redacted or unclear due to excerpt fragmentation.",

It contrasts with prior embedding-based speaker verification (Snyder et al., Desplanques et al., Chen et al.) by evaluating end-to-end judgment capabilities rather than fixed representations. Unlike works on single-utterance quality (e.g., PESQ, CrowdMOS), SpeakerSleuth addresses longitudinal identity coherence, filling a gap in TTS evaluation.

The use of latent diffusion provides high-fidelity audio generation. The programmatic dataset construction pipeline is scalable and ensures strong cross-modal alignment without relying on scarce real-world recordings. The hybrid supervision strategy effectively bridges modalities even in the absence of direct real-world triplets. Integration of pretrained foundation models (CLAP, MetaCLIP) leverages existing knowledge while reducing training overhead.",
    "limitations": "The dataset is primarily synthetic, raising concerns about generalization to real-world, uncontrolled environments despite inclusion of LRS3 data. The reliance on text prompts as a mediating modality may introduce biases or inaccuracies if the text-to-X models misinterpret scene semantics. The computational cost of diffusion models limits real-time deployment. Speaker identity is modeled implicitly through timbre embeddings rather than explicit identity labels, which may limit controllability in multi-speaker scenarios. Environmental acoustics are simplified to procedural simulations and may not capture complex real-world reverberation or noise dynamics.",

Unlike DiffRENT or AST-LDM, which focus on either emotion or basic scene context without disentangling speaker and environment, VividVoice explicitly models both. It also differs from traditional TTS by moving beyond clean, studio-recorded assumptions to embrace real-world acoustic complexity, positioning it at the intersection of multimodal generative AI, spatial audio, and immersive media.",

It demonstrates that emotional prosody is primarily generated in the speech language model (SLM) stage rather than the flow-matching acoustic module.",
    "core_contribution": "The paper addresses the limitation of existing expressive TTS systems that enforce a single, utterance-level emotion label, thereby failing to capture nuanced, mixed, or contextually misaligned emotional expressions found in human speech. CoCoEmo proposes the first systematic analysis of activation steering for emotional control in hybrid TTS architectures, introducing a lightweight, plug-and-play method that injects emotion-specific steering vectors into selected layers of the SLM. This enables fine-grained, composable emotional control—including synthesis of conflicting emotions and mismatched text-emotion scenarios—while preserving linguistic content and avoiding model retraining or architectural changes.",
    "technical_approach": "The authors use two state-of-the-art hybrid TTS backbones: CosyVoice2 and IndexTTS2, both featuring a two-stage architecture comprising a Speech Language Model (SLM) that autoregressively generates discrete speech tokens from text, followed by a flow-matching-based acoustic model that converts tokens to waveforms. Activation steering is implemented by computing emotion-specific direction vectors as the difference between mean latent representations of neutral and target-emotion utterances at specific SLM layers. These vectors are injected additively during inference with a tunable scaling factor α. Steering sites are identified via a discriminability-driven probing approach: linear probes are trained on layer-wise activations to predict emotion labels, and layers with highest probe accuracy are selected for steering. The method supports both single-emotion and mixed-emotion synthesis by linearly combining multiple steering vectors weighted by desired emotion intensities. Text-emotion mismatch scenarios are evaluated by prompting the model with an emotion label that conflicts with the semantic content of the input text.",

    ],
    "methodology": "Experiments are conducted on two English-language hybrid TTS models: CosyVoice2 (with SLM layers 10–17 optimal for steering) and IndexTTS2 (layers 6–9). Steering vectors are extracted from paired emotional speech datasets (CREMA-D, ESD, MELD) where the same speaker utters identical text under different emotions. Datasets are split into train (vector extraction), validation (steering site selection via linear probing), and test sets. Evaluation includes in-distribution (CREMA-D) and out-of-distribution (IEMOCAP) settings. Baselines include native instruction-based prompting (no internal activation modification) and unsteered model outputs. Objective metrics include E-SIM (emotion similarity via embedding cosine distance), TEP (text-emotion preservation measured by semantic consistency under emotion shift), valence-arousal correlation (ρ), human-likeness rate (H-Rate), speaker similarity (S-SIM), and word error rate (WER). Subjective evaluation uses Mean Opinion Score (MOS) with multiple raters. Mixed-emotion evaluation leverages multi-annotator soft labels to construct ground-truth emotion distributions. Text-emotion mismatch is quantified using ℓ2 distance between predicted and expected valence-arousal values under semantic conflict.",
    "key_findings": "Activation steering significantly improves emotional expressiveness: E-SIM increases by up to 0.15 over baselines, and TEP remains high (>0.85) even under strong emotion shifts, indicating preserved linguistic content. Mixed-emotion synthesis achieves higher MOS (up to 4.1 vs. 3.6 for baselines) and better alignment with human-annotated emotion distributions. Crucially, steering applied only to the SLM yields strong emotional control, while steering the flow-matching module produces negligible effects—confirming the SLM as the primary locus of emotional prosody generation. In high-mismatch IEMOCAP scenarios, CoCoEmo maintains naturalness (MOS ~3.9) and low WER (<5%), whereas baseline models exhibit unnatural or collapsed expressiveness. Both models show consistent gains across architectures, validating the generality of the approach.",
    "technical_strengths": "The method is lightweight, requiring no retraining, fine-tuning, or architectural changes—only inference-time activation injection. It enables continuous, composable control over multiple emotions simultaneously. The layer-selection strategy based on linear probing ensures model-specific optimization of steering efficacy. The evaluation rigorously covers in-distribution, out-of-distribution, mixed-emotion, and text-emotion mismatch scenarios using both objective and subjective metrics, setting a new standard for expressive TTS assessment.",
    "limitations": "The approach depends on the availability of paired emotional speech data (same text, same speaker, different emotions) for steering vector extraction, which is scarce and limits scalability to low-resource languages or rare emotions. Steering vectors are static per emotion and do not adapt dynamically to linguistic context beyond the SLM’s internal processing. The method assumes linearity in emotion representation space, which may not hold for highly complex or non-additive emotional blends. Evaluation is limited to English and two specific TTS architectures; generalization to other languages or non-hybrid TTS systems (e.g., end-to-end diffusion models) remains unverified.",
    "future_work": "The authors suggest extending activation steering to dynamic, context-aware emotion trajectories (e.g., emotion shifts within an utterance), exploring non-linear steering mechanisms, and applying the framework to other expressive dimensions like speaker identity or speaking style. They also propose integrating steering with prompt-based interfaces for multimodal control and expanding evaluation to more diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.",

Unlike prompt-based methods that struggle with compositional or conflicting emotions, CoCoEmo operates at the representational level, offering finer control. It also differs from cross-domain emotion modeling by focusing on internal model dynamics rather than external signal processing. This work bridges the gap between interpretable AI (via activation engineering) and expressive speech synthesis, positioning activation steering as a viable alternative to conventional conditioning strategies.",

For the TTS component, over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker audio were recorded using professional-grade equipment in controlled environments. Scripts were phonetically balanced using language-specific phoneme inventories to ensure comprehensive coverage of sound units, which is critical for training neural TTS systems like Tacotron or FastSpeech. Speaker metadata (age, gender, region) was collected, and all voice actors provided informed consent. Audio was sampled at high fidelity (likely 16–48 kHz based on standard TTS practices, though exact specs are not detailed in excerpts). The ASR portion used image-prompted elicitation to capture natural, spontaneous speech across 14 languages, totaling ~1,250 hours.

Language distributions are uneven but reflect population sizes and feasibility (e.g., Swahili, Yoruba, and Hausa have larger allocations). The TTS recordings meet industry standards for synthesis training, with low noise and consistent prosody. The ASR data exhibits high lexical and acoustic diversity due to spontaneous elicitation. Compared to existing resources—such as Mozilla Common Voice (which has sparse African language coverage) or radio-based archives (which lack transcripts and speaker metadata)—WAXAL offers superior scale, structure, and suitability for modern neural TTS/ASR pipelines. No quantitative model performance is reported, as the paper is a data release.",

The inclusion of both spontaneous and read speech supports diverse modeling scenarios. The collaborative, locally grounded collection process enhances linguistic authenticity and ethical integrity, reducing risks of misrepresentation or exploitation common in extractive data practices.",
    "limitations": "The TTS component uses single-speaker recordings per language (in many cases), limiting voice diversity and speaker adaptation research. The ASR data, while diverse, may not fully capture dialectal variation or low-resource regional accents due to recruitment constraints. Only 10 of the 21 languages have TTS data, and only 14 have ASR data, indicating incomplete coverage across the full set. The paper acknowledges potential gaps in demographic representation despite efforts at diversity. Additionally, the absence of detailed audio specifications (e.g., sample rate, bit depth) and lack of pre-trained baseline models reduce immediate usability for some practitioners. Ethical considerations around long-term data stewardship and benefit-sharing with source communities are noted but not fully resolved.",

    "technical_approach": "PFluxTTS employs two independently trained flow-matching TTS models: a Duration-Guided (DG) model that uses explicit phoneme durations for temporal control, and an Alignment-Free (AF) model that operates without explicit alignment but conditions on total utterance duration predicted by the DG model to ensure temporal compatibility. During inference, their respective vector fields are fused using a schedule α(t), which is piecewise-constant (e.g., α=0.75 in experiments), blending the DG field early for stability and the AF field later for naturalness. Both models share a text encoder and use a FLUX block architecture similar to flow-matching decoders. Speaker conditioning differs: the DG model uses a sequence of speech-prompt embeddings from a Speech Prompt Encoder, while the AF model uses a fixed embedding. For audio generation, a modified PeriodWave vocoder upsamples mel features to 48 kHz using a Period-Aware Estimator with stride-4 downsampling, optionally enhanced with AudioSR for super-resolution.
